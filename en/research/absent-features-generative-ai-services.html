            <p>
                <i>Generative AI models have firmly established their presence and show no signs of fading away. With
                    their remarkable capacity for creativity and text generation, one might expect their user interfaces
                    to reflect equally impressive capabilities. However, the reality, as of September 2023 and based on
                    personal experiences with ChatGPT and Bard, reveals a different story. This article explores the
                    existing limitations within the interfaces of these generative AI services and highlights the
                    untapped potential that awaits us.</i>
            </p>
            <h3>Autocompletion</h3>
            <p>One glaring omission in generative AI [1] services, is the absence of an autocompletion feature for
                prompts. This absence prompts the question: Why is there no autocompletion, even as basic as pressing
                the TAB key, when writing prompts for ChatGPT [2] or Bard [3]? It appears paradoxical because generative
                AI models essentially serve as advanced autocompletion tools themselves. Users, who are accustomed to
                the convenience of receiving suggestions as they type in various applications, find it perplexing that
                this feature is not integrated into generative AI platforms.</p>
            <h3>History and Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
            <p>
                As someone deeply familiar with the command line and a fan of keyboard shortcuts, I've noticed a quirky
                habit when interacting with generative AI models through prompts. I often catch myself instinctively
                reaching for the keyboard shortcuts I frequently use in the command line. However, to my disappointment,
                not all of these shortcuts work in the generative AI environment. This isn't an isolated issue specific
                to ChatGPT; rather, it's a universal challenge affecting all generative AI services.
                Given below is a snapshot of some keyboard shortcuts for ChatGPT, but this is indeed a generic problem
                for all the generative AI services.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Action</th>
                    <th>Keyboard Shortcut</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Open new chat</td>
                    <td>Ctrl + Shift + o</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Focus chat input</td>
                    <td>Shift + Esc</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Copy last code block</td>
                    <td>Ctrl + Shift + ;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Copy last response</td>
                    <td>Ctrl + Shift + c</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Set custom instructions</td>
                    <td>Ctrl + Shift + i</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Toggle sidebar</td>
                    <td>Ctrl + Shift + s</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Delete chat</td>
                    <td>Ctrl + Shift + ⌫</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Show shortcuts</td>
                    <td>Ctrl + /</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                One of the expectations many users, including those accustomed to command-line interfaces, bring to the
                table when working with generative AI services is the ability to efficiently navigate their conversation
                history. Specifically, they anticipate the convenience of using the up and down arrow keys to access
                previous prompts and responses. This feature allows for a more seamless and contextual interaction, akin
                to scrolling through a conversation log. However, this valuable functionality is often lacking in
                generative AI services, including ChatGPT, leaving users like myself wanting for a more intuitive and
                history-friendly experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Search and Filter</h3>
            <p>
                Efficiently retrieving previous conversations is a common need for users of generative AI services like
                ChatGPT and Bard, especially for those who engage in numerous interactions. Frustratingly, these
                platforms often lack a basic search and filter feature, forcing users to either wade through a sea of
                past chats or redundantly recreate conversations. The absence of such a seemingly fundamental feature
                raises questions about why, given the "advanced capabilities" of these models, the implementation of a
                straightforward search and filter function remains elusive.
            </p>

            <h3>Tags and Categories</h3>
            <p>
                While the development of basic or advanced search capabilities may not currently be a priority for
                generative AI services, there is an alternative approach that could significantly enhance user
                experience. By providing users with the ability to add tags to individual conversations and organize
                them into distinct categories, these services can offer a practical interim solution. This feature
                allows users to efficiently manage and retrieve their previous interactions, filling the gap until
                comprehensive search capabilities are eventually integrated.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of generative AI, the enduring presence and expanding capabilities of
                these models are undeniable. Yet, as of September 2023, our exploration into generative AI services,
                including ChatGPT and Bard, has unveiled notable shortcomings in their user interfaces. These
                limitations encompass the absence of essential features for prompt writing such as autocompletion,
                keyboard shortcuts, efficient navigation of conversation history, and basic search and filter functions.
            </p>
            <p>However, amidst these challenges, there is a glimmer of hope. The potential for enhancing user experience
                lies not only in the promise of future search capabilities but also in a practical interim solution –
                the introduction of tags and categories. By empowering users to organize their conversations with these
                tools, generative AI services can bridge the gap, offering improved conversation management and
                retrieval. As we move forward, we eagerly anticipate the evolution of generative AI services, as they
                work to unlock their full potential and provide users with richer, more user-friendly experiences in the
                exciting world of AI-driven text generation.</p>
