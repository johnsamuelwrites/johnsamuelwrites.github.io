                The web is constantly evolving and so does user behaviour.
                Th recent release of Large language models, like ChatGPT, Bard, Claude means that t is possible to converse 
		directly to the search engines to get answers.
		In the past, website owners used a lot of ways to optimize their web content using techniques called search engine 
		optimization to ensure that their content arrive on the first few pages of the search engine results for
		specific user queries.
		However, we will soon enter into an era, where users may not need to click any external links and may directly
		get their responses on the search engines integrated with large language models.
		This will usher a new area of optimization techniques often called AI engine optimization.
            </p>
	    <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The web is constantly evolving and so does user behaviour.
                From consulting the websites for the latest news to checking the news on the social media sites, the
                change was very rapid.
                With the constant development and enhancements of the search engines, often times, there is no need to consult
                websites for a number of simple questions
                like getting the local temperature, the height of a mountain, the distance between two cities, the
                population of a country, etc.
                And the very release of large search engines means that there is no more need to use keywords to make these searches.
                It is possible to converse directly to the search engines to get answers.
            </p>
	    <h3>Generative AI</h3>
            <p>
	        This recent development has been made possible because of the availability of generative AI models, and especially
		that large language models (LLMs).
		These LLMs are capable to generate text to a wide range of user needs, like question answering, document summarization, etc.
		However, LLMs are models trained with the data already available on the internet upto a certain date.
		Any queries related to the information after this date are not fully accurate.
                However, it's also possible to connect the large language models directly to the internet.
		This means that we have soon ask questions about real-time events.
                Take, for example, the integration of large language models like ChatGPT with the search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
	        But these evolutions in search engines as well as the user behaviours did not appear all of a sudden.
		It took more than two decades for us to arrive to this point.
                From article excerpts to information boxes on the search engines, the web has changed very rapidly.
                It is slowly resulting in a behaviour where the user no longer needs to click the outgoing links in the
                search results, but can obtain the answer from the main site.
                Everything in one single place, from questions to answers without leaving the site.
                This big vision is slowly taking hold as the default behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some interesting scenarios will emerge when LLMs are fully integrated to the search engines.
                Users will go to the website of the search engines and conversing with them to get not just the latest news, but also the updates of 
		a news development since the last time they conversed with the search engine.
                They would ask the latest news of a city or a country or the latest development with respect to a current legislation, a current political problem, a
                sports event, the persons who voted in favour of the legislation, the viewpoints of a given person with respect to a particular legislation,
                the team Who won the recent tournament, etc.
                They could even ask the search engines to narrate the news from the perspective of political side (right, left, conservative,
                liberal,..)
            </p>
            <p>
		The questions could be even more complex.
		Instead of just asking the distance and the available travel options between Lyon to Paris, they would ask whether it rain during
		their journey from Lyon to Paris and to provide an ecological solution for this travel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users would ask the product reviews, specify their needs and budget and ask for the best products
		that completely match their requirements and suits their budget.
                During this conversation, they could get a quick or a detailed review of products, or a much elaborate comparison of multiple products
                and even the possibilit of buying these products during this conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both employers and employees could ask to describe the portfolio of a given company from different viewpoints, like 
		profitability, employee satisfation, the performance of the company during the last few years, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
	        Considering the deluge of scientific research works published daily, the scientists would ask for
                the most recent dvelopments in their given research field, ask fo brief summaries of specific scientific articles, 
                the challenges solved by them as well as  the remaining challenges or the future persepctives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developers will precise the specification and ask the search engines to build an application and 
                share it to the application store.
		The search engines will provide them with an elaborate plan to build and even deploy it on the server.
            </p>
            <p>

                These are some of the various interesting simple and complex questions that will be answered by the AI
                engines when they are fully connected to the internet.
		All of the above may sound scince fiction, but the last few months have demonstrated some promising 
		initial results along with certain issues and challenges.
            </p>
	    <h3>From SEO to AI engine optimization</h3>
            <p>
	        However, here comes the major problem.
                In the past, the humans wrote the answers on forums, blogs, websites, etc.
                They answered these questions in the form of blog posts, code snippets, etc.
		Humans produced a vast amount of content on the internet which were then later consumed by humans.
		Machines also helped a lot during the process.
		Because of the multitude of articles on a single topic, search engines employed various ways 
		to present the relevant results to user search queries.
                That being said, website owners also employed diffferent techniques to make their 
		website appear on the search results.
		Techniques like search engine optimization suggested the different ways by which your website could
                appear in the top 10 results (or on the first few pages).
            </p>
            <p>
	        However, the LLM based search engines do not need to provide the links to the sources of all these 
		websites.
		They could simply summarize or predict the content to the user based on these sources.
		What does it mean to the companies?
                This means a new technique calld AI engine optimization or
                or LLM based search engine optimization will become centerplace of the company strategies.
                Not that this is completely different from AI powered SEO since the goal is to improve the ranking (or SERP ranking).
		In case of AI engine optimization, the goal will be to ensure that a company or their product appears in the
		predicted or summarized text of the search engines for user queries.
		We are still in the beginning phase and we will soon see how advertistments will be integrated
		to the conversations with the search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal AI is almost here, where answers will be tailored in a manner that is preferred
		by the user.
                This brings us to the upcoming challenge in the future.
		Will we continue producing content like in the past.
		Why would anyone ever prepare a website, when users need not click any website.
                Who is going to prepare the answsers for these questions in the upcoming years
		The blogsphere is worried about all these aspects.
                The foundation of the web is its openness
                For those of us coming from the blogging days, this change is indeed very difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last, but not the least, another major challenge is the limitation of these models when it comes to 
		multilingual questions and answers.
		These models have been trained on large swaths of internet content, which are dominated usually by a certain number of languages.
		What about the underserved languages on the internet.
              	Does this mean that the people speaking these languages will not be able to use these search engines? 
		If people stops producing content on the internet, this may have an indirect impact on these languages and
		the future training of the large language models.
            </p>
	    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
	       The appearance of Large language models and their integration with the  search engines have brought forward
	       some very serious questions.
	       The generative nature of LLMs means that any search engine integrated with LLM can answer user queries
	       and the users need not click any external websites.
	       This may have an impact on the revenue of website of product owners.
	       There is a growing feeling that the AI engine optimization will provide some techniques
	       to the users to ensure that the content from their website are integrated in the responses of 
	       conversations with the search engines.
	       There are also fears that some bloggers may stop producing content on the web at all and this new behaviour
	       may have an indirect impact on small resource languages, which will indireclty impact their integration 
	       with the LLMs.
            </p>
