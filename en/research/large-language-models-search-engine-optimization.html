                <i>The internet is in a constant state of evolution, paralleling shifts in user behavior. Recent
                    releases
                    of large language models, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, have ushered in a new era where direct
                    conversations with search engines yield instant answers. </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Historically, website owners employed various search engine optimization techniques to ensure their
                    content ranked prominently on search engine results pages for specific user queries. However, we are
                    on
                    the verge of a new era, where users may no longer need to click external links; instead, they can
                    receive responses directly from search engines integrated with large language models.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>This impending transformation marks the emergence of a new field known as AI engine optimization.
                    Furthermore, this development poses both opportunities and challenges, including complex queries,
                    product recommendations, and multilingual support. While this shift may raise concerns for content
                    creators, it presents exciting prospects for personalized AI-driven interactions and more efficient
                    information retrieval.</i>
            </p>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The internet is in a state of perpetual evolution, mirroring the ever-changing landscape of user
                behavior.
                Previously, people would visit websites to stay updated with the latest news, but this dynamic shifted
                rapidly.
                Thanks to continuous advancements in search engine technology, many straightforward queries—such as
                checking the local temperature, determining a mountain's height, finding the distance between two
                cities, or learning a country's population—no longer necessitate navigating websites.
                The advent of powerful search engines has eliminated the need for traditional keyword-based searches,
                allowing users to engage in direct conversations with these engines to obtain answers.

            </p>
            <h3>Generative AI</h3>
            <p>
                This recent advancement owes its existence to the availability of generative AI models [1], notably
                large
                language models (LLMs) [2, 3].
                These LLMs possess the capacity to generate text that caters to a wide array of user requirements,
                including question answering and document summarization, among others.
                However, it's important to note that LLMs are trained on data available on the internet up to a specific
                date.
                Consequently, inquiries pertaining to information beyond this date may not yield entirely accurate
                results.
                Nonetheless, a notable development is the direct connection of large language models to the internet.
                This enables users to pose real-time questions about current events.
                For instance, consider the integration of large language models like ChatGPT with the internet [4].
            </p>
            <p>
                The transformations we observe in search engines and user behaviors didn't happen overnight; rather,
                they unfolded over the course of more than two decades. We've witnessed a swift evolution from article
                excerpts to information boxes prominently displayed on search engine results pages.
                This shift is gradually shaping a user behavior where clicking outbound links in search results is
                becoming less necessary. Instead, users can access answers directly from the main site.
                This holistic approach, where questions and answers coexist seamlessly within a single platform, is
                progressively becoming the default behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                When large language models (LLMs) become fully integrated into search engines, it will open up
                intriguing possibilities for users.
                They will visit search engine websites and engage in conversations, not only to receive the latest news
                but also to obtain updates on news developments since their last interaction with the search engine.
                Users will be able to inquire about the most recent news in a city or country, track the progress of
                ongoing legislation or political issues, stay updated on sports events, learn about the individuals who
                supported a particular legislation, explore various perspectives on these topics, and even request news
                narratives from different political viewpoints, be it right, left, conservative, liberal, and more.

            </p>
            <p>
                The questions posed to search engines could become even more intricate.
                Instead of merely inquiring about the distance and available travel options from Lyon to Paris, users
                might seek information on weather conditions during their journey and request eco-friendly travel
                solutions for this route.

            </p>
            <p>
                Users will have the capability to request product reviews, outline their specific needs and budget, and
                seek recommendations for products that precisely align with their requirements and budget constraints.
                These interactions could yield quick or in-depth product reviews, comprehensive comparisons of multiple
                products, and even the option to make purchases directly within the conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both employers and employees will have the ability to inquire about a company's portfolio from various
                angles, such as profitability, employee satisfaction, the company's performance over recent years, and
                more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the constant influx of scientific research publications, scientists will be able to request the
                latest developments in their respective research fields.
                They can seek concise summaries of specific scientific articles, inquire about the challenges these
                studies have addressed, as well as the remaining obstacles and future prospects in those areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developers can specify their requirements and request search engines to create an application and submit
                it to the application store.
                The search engines will offer them a comprehensive plan for development and deployment, including server
                deployment.

            </p>
            <p>
                These represent just a selection of the intriguing and diverse questions that AI engines will be capable
                of addressing when fully integrated with the internet.
                While some of these concepts might seem like science fiction, the past few months have showcased
                promising initial outcomes, albeit alongside certain issues and challenges.

            </p>
            <h3>From SEO to AI engine optimization</h3>
            <p>
                However, a significant challenge arises.
                Historically, humans authored answers on forums, blogs, websites, and other platforms.
                They addressed questions through blog posts, provided code snippets, and generated an extensive body of
                online content, which was subsequently consumed by other humans.
                Machines played a vital role in this process as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the sheer volume of articles on any given topic, search engines adopted various methods to
                present relevant results for user queries.
                Simultaneously, website owners employed diverse techniques to enhance their website's visibility in
                search results.
                Practices like search engine optimization (SEO) offered different strategies for achieving a coveted
                position in the top 10 search results or on the first few pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, LLM-based search engines no longer require providing links to the sources of all these
                websites.
                Instead, they can offer summaries or predictions of content directly to users based on these sources
                [5, 6].

            </p>
            <p>
                What does this mean for companies? It signifies the emergence of a novel technique known as AI engine
                optimization [7, 8, 10, 11, 12] or LLM-based search engine optimization, which will take center stage
                in company
                strategies.
                While this concept shares some similarities with AI-powered SEO [13, 14], the primary objective shifts
                from
                improving search engine ranking (SERP ranking) to ensuring a company or its products appear in the
                predicted or summarized text generated by search engines for user queries.
                We are still in the early stages of this evolution, and in the near future, we will witness how
                advertisements are integrated into conversations with search engines.

                Personal AI is on the brink of becoming a reality, where answers will be tailored to suit the user's
                preferences.
                However, this leads us to a looming challenge for the future.
                Will we continue generating content as we have in the past? Why would anyone invest in creating a
                website when users no longer need to visit them for answers?
            </p>
            <p>
                The question arises: Who will provide the answers to these inquiries in the years to come? These
                concerns are a source of worry within the blogosphere [5, 6, 9].
                At the core of the web lies its openness, but for those of us who hail from the blogging era, adapting
                to this transformative shift is undeniably challenging.

                Last but certainly not least, another significant challenge lies in the limitations of these models when
                confronted with multilingual questions and answers [15, 16, 17].
                These models have been trained on extensive portions of internet content, which tend to be predominantly
                in a select few languages.
                This raises questions about languages that are underrepresented on the internet.
                Does it imply that speakers of these languages will be unable to utilize these search engines? If
                content creation dwindles on the internet, it may indirectly impact these languages and the future
                training of large language models.

            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration with search engines have given rise
                to profound questions and implications.
                The generative capabilities of LLMs empower search engines integrated with them to respond directly to
                user queries, obviating the need for users to click on external websites.
                This paradigm shift raises concerns about the revenue streams of website owners and product creators, as
                traditional web traffic may decline.
                To address this, the concept of AI engine optimization is gaining traction, offering strategies for
                owners to ensure their website content becomes part of the responses generated by conversations with
                search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simultaneously, there are apprehensions that some bloggers may cease producing web content altogether
                due to this changing landscape.
                Such a trend could have indirect repercussions on less-represented languages on the internet,
                potentially affecting their integration with LLMs.
                In this evolving landscape, the intersection of AI, search engines, and content creation presents both
                opportunities and challenges, driving the need for creative solutions to ensure a harmonious coexistence
                between the digital world and content creators, while also promoting linguistic diversity and
                inclusivity in the era of AI-powered interactions.
