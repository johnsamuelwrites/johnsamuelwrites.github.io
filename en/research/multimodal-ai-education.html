            <p>
                In the past year, significant strides have been made in the field of AI, particularly in <b>generative
                    models</b> [1]. Despite this progress, much of the attention has been directed toward <b>textual</b>
                generative AI models, leaving other AI models for image, slides, and video generation in the shadows.
                This prompts a reflection on the predominant text-based nature of our education system. For individuals
                in STEM disciplines, it's common to encounter slides and textbooks that lean heavily towards textual
                content, often with minimal emphasis on visual elements. This observation raises questions about the
                balance between textual and visual components in educational materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're acquainted with my online ventures, you've likely noticed my inclination to explore both
                visual and textual realms, weaving together photography and occasional videos. The advent of generative
                AI models has undeniably transformed these creative pursuits. If you've engaged in generating texts,
                images, or videos using prompts, you've also likely witnessed the evolution in their generation over
                time.
                While the initial release of these models sparked considerable debates [2,3,4], especially within the
                education sector, I'll steer clear of looking into those discussions here. Instead, I'm reserving the
                space for a future exploration of the potential impact of generative AI on education—stay tuned for that
                intriguing conversation. For now, let's shift our focus to the imperative of exploring multimodal AI in
                the realm of education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two critical facets demand our attention: the <b>learning profiles</b> of students and their existing
                knowledge base. Traditional education often assumes a uniform baseline of knowledge among students, a
                notion that doesn't align with reality. Students harbor diverse interests and varying depths of
                knowledge acquired from external sources. This diversity places some students in a position of
                revisiting familiar terrain during class discussions, a scenario where the implementation of spaced
                repetition could be beneficial. However, this begs the question of whether their classroom time could be
                better spent exploring more advanced topics. Conversely, there are students who may lack essential
                skills for a new course, hindering their comprehension. This underscores the challenge of catering to
                diverse student needs within a singular educational framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building on the aforementioned point, the diversity in students' <b>learning preferences</b> is a
                significant factor often overlooked in our predominantly textual education system. Addressing this,
                there arises a need to align educational content with students' <b>preferred media</b>. The challenge of
                creating content in multiple formats may seem daunting for educators, yet leveraging the versatility of
                prompts in generating diverse media can be a potent solution [5,6]. This opens up exciting possibilities
                for tailoring educational materials to suit individual learning styles, fostering a more inclusive and
                engaging learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                We stand at the threshold of a potential revolution in the education sector, one driven by the
                integration of AI tools that could pave the way for <b>personalized courses</b> [7,8,9] tailored to
                individual students. Picture a classroom where teachers seamlessly address questions they might not have
                immediate answers to by directing students to pertinent sources, leveraging the vast informational
                landscape. Envision students adorned with headphones, each navigating their educational journey at a
                personalized pace. This prompts us to ponder the evolving role of teachers in this transformed
                educational landscape. Will they transition into <b>facilitators</b>, guiding students [10] through a
                customized learning experience? The prospect of reimagining traditional classroom dynamics sparks
                curiosity about the unfolding narrative of education in this AI-driven era.
