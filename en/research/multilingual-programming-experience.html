                <i>
                    Lots of efforts are being made in order to make mobile and web applications available to users in
                    their local languages.
                    Often, this effort involves translating the user interfaces and the required information in multiple
                    human languages.
                    With the growing usage of internet and that of mobile devices, digital literacy has become a
                    neccesity requiring us humans to understand, use and even communicate with
                    our digital devices.
                    However, a major question remains, what about the people building these devices?
                    Are they able to develop them using their local languages?
                    Is it possible to create a programming language where developers could program in any human language
                    to communicate with the machines?
                </i>
            </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Language literacy generally involves the capacity to read, write, and express one's feelings or
                needs in one or more human languages in order to communicate wth other human beings.
                With the growing use of mobile phones and computers, there is an emerging impression that
                these devices have become an integral part of human lives.
                Internet usage is growing across all the world.
                Almost every aspect of our lives is now being done on the web through internet.
                Natural languages or human languages gave us the capacity to communicate with other humans.
                Similarly, developers use programming languages to communicate with the machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to understand the different ways by which we human users communicate with the machines,
                especially computers.
                Graphical user interfaces (GUI) and command line are some of the commonly used ones.
                GUI provide users a menu and a set of available options and users choose the
                desired option either by mouse or some keyboard shortcuts.
                As developers understood that many of their software, mobile or web applications are also used by
                non-English users, they started looking for ways to bring their applications to users in their local
                languages.
            </p>
            <h3>Localization and internationalization</h3>
            <p>
                We now seeing a trend by application developers and service providers to provide user
                interfaces in local languages so that users can interact with an application in their local languages.
                Localization and internationalization efforts has now taken a significant place in application
                development.
                It must be highlighted that the number of supported languages is significantly lower compared
                to nearly 7000 human languages.
                Translations are usually available in languages spoken among a large majority of people.
                Yet, there are thousands of under-served languages on the internet.
                We recently celebrated the International year of indigenous languages in 2019, which brought the
                discussion of indigenous languages on an international level.
                This year-long campaign brought attention to the fact that a lot needs to be done to save a number of
                languages from extinction.
                Both digital and literacy campaigns must take into consideration that no language goes extinct in this
                digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot has been done to improve internationalization anf localization of applications.
                We have expanded the text encoding standards from ASCII to Unicode to support more languages of the
                world.
                Inbuilt localization libraries now ensure that any information is presented in a format comprehensible
                to users.
                There are two major aspects towards providing a multilingual user experience: human-computer interface
                and programming language.
                Ensuring a multilingual experience via human-computer interface usually requires that the information
                is written and expressed in the multiple human languages.
                This means that the application developers provide the user interface in their own local languages of
                the writer as well as other human languages spoken by them.
                Standardization of internationalization and localization now means that the translation of user
                interfaces to
                one or more languages now can be easily done, sometimes even without the expertise of software
                development.
                However, the second aspect is often overlooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                The translation efforts of user interfaces only takes into account the users of a given software or
                service.
                But what about the developers of these softwares, services and their associated interfaces.
                It has been observed that a large number of programming languages use English-like
                keywords [1]. Even the command line [2] with its subcommands and associated parameters
                make a significant use of English words or abbreviations
                and mnemonics built from English words.
                This sometimes make it difficult for developers whose primary language is not English to start
                programming.
                They do not quickly understand the reasons behind certain abbreviations, like <i>ls</i> stands for
                <i>list</i>,
                <i>cd</i> stands for <i>change directory</i>, <i>-o</i> stands for <i>output</i>, etc.
                It's much easier for English speakers to memorize these abbreviations.
            </p>
            <h3>Towards Multilingual Natural Language Programming</h3>
            <p>
                Considering the manuals, blogs and documentation on programming languages, we do see that
                more content developers and programmers now increasingly produce informative articles in multiple
                languages.
                However, this is not the same as programming in a local human language, since abbreviations, keywords
                are not expressed in their local lanugages.
                They mentally translate their ideas using the available choices in a given programming language.
                Some programmers understood this problem and they proposed and created new programming languages using
                keywords in their local languages.
                This is called Non-English-based programming languages.
                This requires that such a programming language support keywords, user messages, variable, class or
                function names in a given local language.
                The developer of a non-Engligh based programming language can easily program in their local language.
                But a careful reader will understand the problem here.
                Software development does not just mean writing code.
                It also requires maintaing code.
                If the readers of the code does not understand the meaning of the code that they have not written,
                it is usually difficult for them to correct bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another approach could be to support a programming language that uses human-language agnostic keywords.
                This could be in the form of numerical identifiers.
                However, a program is another form of text, where the writer writes cryptic messages that they can
                understand and can easily be converted to the underlying machine code.
                Using numerical identifiers for keywords and variable, function or class names may make machine
                readability, but no human can properly understand the complete logic of the program.
                We may add another layer, similar to internationalization efforts, where every numerical identifier is
                translated to keywords in local languages and comprehensible names of variables, functions or classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, with the advent of generative AI models, or large language models, we now feel that the
                translation of human languages to any machine code or any exisiting programming language now seems
                feasible.
                A natural language programming language envisions a future where users could write a program in their
                local language without thinking about the keywords or even understanding the basics of programming.
                They ask the machine to generate a code to achieve a particular task and the machine responds either by
                execting the task or generates an executable machine code that can be later executed by the user.
                Any new user can now use this machine code, requests the AI model to help understand the goal of the
                machine code, without even knowing the language of the original writer.
                Thus the new users may debug the errors or extend the code to suit their needs.
                Have we yet arrived to this level of AI models?
                Recall that not all large language models are multilingual.

            <p>
                In this digital world, it is not just enough that we just communicate with other human beings.
                We also require ways to communicate with the machines.
                In the past, developers used programming lanugages to communicate with the machines.
                However, most of these programming languages required some knowledge of English to start programming or
                understand the reasons behing the choice of words or keywords by the programming language developers.
                One could create many non-English based programming languages, but the maintenance of such a code will
                be difficult for the programmers who do not understand the underlying human language of this programming
                language.
                Generative AI models, esepcially large language models may give us the hope that we can communicate with
                machines in our primary languages.
                However, it must be recalled that not all large language models are completely multilinugal, i.e., they
                support all human languages.
