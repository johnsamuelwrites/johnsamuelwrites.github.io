                        rise.
                        These endeavors often involve translating user interfaces and essential documentation into
                        multiple
                        human languages. In today's world, where internet usage and mobile device adoption continue to
                        surge, digital literacy has become a necessity. It demands that we, as users, not only
                        understand
                        and use our digital devices but also communicate with them effectively.

                        these

                        it conceivable to create a programming language that empowers developers to communicate with

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Language literacy typically encompasses the ability to read, write, and articulate one's emotions or
                    requirements in one or multiple human languages to facilitate communication with fellow human
                    beings.
                    With the increasing prevalence of mobile phones and computers, it is evident that these devices have
                    become indispensable in our daily lives.
                    Internet usage is on the rise globally, and nearly every facet
                    of our existence is now conducted online via the internet.
                    Human languages enable us to communicate with
                    each other, while developers employ programming languages to interact with machines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Understanding the various methods through which human users communicate with machines, particularly
                    computers, is crucial.
                    Graphical user interfaces (GUI) and command-line interfaces are among the
                    commonly employed methods.
                    GUIs offer users a menu with a range of available options, allowing them to
                    select their preferred option using either a mouse or keyboard shortcuts.
                    Recognizing that many
                    software, including mobile and web applications, are used by non-English-speaking users, developers
                    have
                    begun exploring ways to make their applications accessible in users' local languages.
                </p>
                <h3>Localization and internationalization</h3>
                <p>
                    There is currently a noticeable trend among application developers and service providers to offer
                    user
                    interfaces in local languages, enabling users to engage with applications in their native tongues.
                    Localization and internationalization efforts have gained significant importance in application
                    development.
                    It is important to note, however, that the number of supported languages is considerably
                    smaller when compared to the nearly 7,000 human languages in existence.
                    Translations are typically
                    available for languages spoken by a large majority of people, leaving thousands of less common
                    languages
                    underserved on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, we celebrated the International Year of Indigenous Languages, which elevated the discussion
                    of
                    indigenous languages to an international level.
                    This year-long campaign drew attention to the pressing
                    need to preserve many languages from the brink of extinction.
                    It's imperative for both digital and
                    literacy campaigns to recognize that no language should face extinction in this digital age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Significant progress has been made in enhancing the internationalization and localization of
                    applications. Text encoding standards have evolved from ASCII to Unicode, enabling support for a
                    wider
                    array of world languages. Inbuilt localization libraries now ensure that information is presented in
                    a
                    comprehensible format for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating a multilingual user experience involves two major aspects: the human-computer interface and
                    the
                    programming language. Achieving a multilingual experience through the human-computer interface
                    typically
                    entails expressing information in multiple human languages. This means that application developers
                    must
                    provide the user interface in both their native language and other languages spoken by their users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The standardization of internationalization and localization has made it easier to translate user
                    interfaces into one or more languages, sometimes without the need for specialized software
                    development
                    expertise. However, the importance of addressing the second aspect, the programming language, is
                    often
                    underestimated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Translation efforts for user interfaces typically focus on making software and services accessible
                    to
                    their users, but what about the developers behind these software and their associated interfaces?
                    It's
                    been observed that many programming languages utilize keywords that resemble English [1]. Even the
                    command line [2], with its subcommands and associated parameters, heavily relies on English words,
                    abbreviations, and mnemonics constructed from English words. This can pose challenges for developers
                    whose primary language is not English, as they may struggle to quickly grasp the rationale behind
                    certain abbreviations. For example, understanding that "<i>ls</i>" stands for "<i>list</i>,"
                    "<i>cd</i>"
                    stands for "<i>change directory</i>," and "<i>-o</i>" stands for "<i>output</i>" is more
                    straightforward
                    for English speakers who can easily memorize these abbreviations.
                </p>
                <h3>Towards Multilingual Natural Language Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    When we look at manuals, blogs, and documentation on programming languages, it's evident that more
                    content developers and programmers are producing informative articles in multiple languages.
                    However,
                    this is distinct from programming in a local human language, as abbreviations and keywords are not
                    typically expressed in these local languages. Instead, developers mentally translate their ideas
                    using
                    the available constructs within a given programming language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognizing this challenge, some programmers have proposed and created new programming languages
                    that
                    utilize keywords in their local languages, referred to as Non-English-based programming languages
                    [3].
                    This
                    approach necessitates that such a programming language supports keywords, user messages, variables,
                    classes, and function names in the local language. Developers of these non-English-based programming
                    languages can comfortably program in their native language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, a critical issue arises here. Software development involves not only writing code but also
                    maintaining it. If individuals reading the code cannot understand the meaning of code they haven't
                    written, it can be quite challenging for them to identify and correct bugs or make modifications.
                    This
                    highlights the importance of striking a balance between linguistic accessibility and code
                    maintainability in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An alternative approach could involve supporting a programming language that utilizes human-language
                    agnostic [4] keywords, potentially in the form of numerical identifiers. However, it's important to
                    recognize that a program is essentially another form of text, where the writer conveys their logic
                    in a
                    concise manner that they can understand, and which can be translated into the underlying machine
                    code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using numerical identifiers for keywords, variables, functions, or class names may enhance machine
                    readability, but it often results in code that is cryptic and incomprehensible to humans. To address
                    this challenge, we might consider adding another layer, akin to internationalization efforts, where
                    every numerical identifier is translated into keywords in local languages and replaced with
                    understandable names for variables, functions, or classes. This would bridge the gap between machine
                    readability and human comprehension, offering a potential solution to the issue of language barriers
                    in
                    programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of a natural language programming [5, 6, 7], where users can write code in their local
                    language
                    without needing to understand traditional programming keywords, has been a long-standing aspiration
                    in
                    the field of computer science. With the emergence of generative AI models [8], such as large
                    language
                    models [9], we've made significant progress toward this vision. These models have the potential to
                    translate
                    human languages into machine code or existing programming languages, making it more accessible for
                    individuals who are not proficient in traditional programming languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this scenario, users could instruct the machine in their local language to generate code for
                    specific
                    tasks. The machine could then either execute the task directly or produce an executable machine code
                    that the user can run later. This approach could empower new users to work with machine-generated
                    code,
                    even if they don't understand the language in which the original code was written. They could
                    request
                    assistance from the AI model to comprehend the code's purpose, debug errors, or make modifications
                    to
                    adapt it to their needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While substantial progress has been made in the development of generative AI models, it's essential
                    to
                    note that not all large language models are multilingual [10, 11, 12]. Some models are trained
                    primarily
                    in specific
                    languages and may not provide robust support for every language in the world. However, ongoing
                    research
                    and advancements in AI continue to move us closer to realizing the vision of natural language
                    programming languages that can bridge language barriers in coding.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    In our increasingly digital world, communication isn't limited to interactions among humans; it
                    extends
                    to our interactions with machines. Historically, developers have used programming languages as the
                    bridge between human intent and machine execution. However, many of these programming languages
                    necessitated some level of familiarity with English, either to start programming or to understand
                    the
                    rationale behind the language's choice of words and keywords by its developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While creating non-English-based programming languages is a potential solution, it introduces
                    challenges
                    in terms of code maintenance, especially for programmers who lack proficiency in the language
                    underlying
                    the programming language itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The emergence of generative AI models, particularly large language models, offers a glimmer of hope
                    for
                    enabling communication with machines in our primary languages. However, it's crucial to acknowledge
                    that
                    not all large language models are entirely multilingual; that is, they may not comprehensively
                    support
                    all human languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we navigate this evolving landscape of multilingual programming, it's clear that the pursuit of
                    more
                    accessible and inclusive technology continues. The future may hold innovative solutions that further
                    bridge the gap between human languages and machine communication, fostering a more inclusive and
                    diverse
                    digital world.
