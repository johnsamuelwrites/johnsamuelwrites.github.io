                    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, PaLM, and Galactica have revolutionized natural
                        language processing by enabling machines to generate coherent and contextually relevant text
                        across many languages. However, the benefits of these models are disproportionately distributed,
                        favoring high-resource languages with extensive digital corpora. This article discusses the
                        critical role of language communities in supporting under-resourced and endangered languages in
                        the context of LLM development and deployment, and explores collaborative strategies involving
                        researchers, policymakers, language activists, and technologists to promote linguistic diversity
                        in AI systems.</p>

                    <h3>Availability of Large Language Models for Selected Languages</h3>

                    <p>Most publicly available LLMs have been predominantly trained on large-scale datasets derived from
                        widely spoken languages, such as English, Mandarin, Spanish, and French. Consequently, many
                        under-resourced languages, particularly Indigenous, minority, and endangered languages, remain
                        underserved. The scarcity of digital text corpora, limited linguistic resources, and lack of
                        annotated datasets challenge the development of effective LLMs for these languages.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07264">low-resource language</a> problem poses
                        significant risks for
                        digital inequality and cultural erosion, as linguistic communities without adequate
                        technological support face marginalization in the digital era. It is imperative that language
                        communities, together with AI researchers and policymakers, address these challenges through
                        concerted efforts in data collection, curation, and model development.</p>

                    <h3>Documentation and Ethical Data Collection</h3>

                    <p>One of the foundational steps toward supporting under-resourced languages is thorough linguistic
                        documentation. This includes recording oral traditions, collecting written materials, and
                        conducting interviews with native speakers with their informed consent. Ethical data collection
                        practices must prioritize the autonomy, privacy, and cultural sensitivities of language
                        communities to avoid exploitation or misappropriation of linguistic heritage.</p>

                    <p>Language documentation projects often identify essential vocabulary, phrases, and contextual
                        usage relevant for everyday communication and specialized domains. These data serve as valuable
                        resources for building language models, lexicons, and translation systems. Initiatives such as
                        the <a href="https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/">Endangered Languages Project</a> and <a
                            href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/best-practices-and-lessons-learned-preserve-revitalize-and-promote-indigenous-languages">UNESCO’s
                            language revitalization programs</a>
                        provide frameworks and best practices for such work.</p>

                    <h3>Improving Data Quality and Quantity for All Languages</h3>

                    <p>Enhancing the data available for under-resourced languages requires multi-faceted approaches,
                        including community participation, crowdsourcing, and partnerships with academic institutions.
                        The use of open-source platforms and accessible tools empowers speakers to contribute linguistic
                        data actively, thus improving both data quantity and quality. Moreover, the digitization of
                        archival texts and oral recordings helps expand corpora available for LLM training.</p>

                    <p>Even high-resource languages face challenges adapting to evolving terminologies, such as new
                        scientific and technical terms. Language communities play a vital role in coining, translating,
                        and standardizing these terms. Traditionally, official language bodies or academic institutions
                        have led this work. However, with LLMs generating multiple possible translations, ensuring the
                        accuracy and consistency of official terminology has become more complex.</p>

                    <h3>Ensuring Official and Consistent Translations with LLMs</h3>

                    <p>As LLMs generate diverse outputs, including multiple translations for the same term or phrase,
                        language communities must establish mechanisms to validate and endorse official translations.
                        This validation process is critical in specialized fields where precision matters, such as law,
                        medicine, and technology. Collaboration between linguistic authorities, translators, and AI
                        developers is essential to embed such standards into model training and fine-tuning phases.</p>

                    <p>Feedback from language communities can inform iterative improvement of LLMs. This feedback may
                        include identifying errors, suggesting preferred lexical choices, and highlighting culturally
                        appropriate language usage. Incorporating community input during model fine-tuning ensures that
                        LLMs respect linguistic norms and contribute positively to language preservation and evolution.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Collaboration Between Language Communities and LLM Developers</h3>

                    <p>Successful integration of under-resourced languages into LLMs demands ongoing collaboration
                        between language communities, AI developers, and policymakers. AI companies must engage with
                        communities transparently, respecting data sovereignty and intellectual property rights.
                        Participatory approaches, such as <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science">citizen science</a> and crowdsourcing,
                        can harness
                        collective knowledge and foster empowerment.</p>

                    <p>Institutional support through funding, policy frameworks, and infrastructure is equally vital.
                        International organizations like UNESCO, the United Nations, and the <a
                            href="https://www.ethnologue.com">Ethnologue</a>
                        contribute to language preservation agendas that can align with technological development.
                        National language academies and educational institutions play roles in standardization and
                        resource creation.</p>

                    <h3>Data Governance, Licensing, and Ethical Considerations</h3>

                    <p>Data governance frameworks must prioritize ethical concerns, including informed consent, privacy,
                        and cultural sensitivity. Open licenses such as <a
                            href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons</a> facilitate the
                        sharing of linguistic data
                        while protecting contributors' rights. At the same time, mechanisms for community control over
                        data use, sometimes referred to as data sovereignty, are increasingly recognized as essential
                        for respecting Indigenous and minority groups’ interests.</p>

                    <p>Ensuring transparency about how data are used, stored, and integrated into LLMs is fundamental to
                        building trust between developers and language communities. Ethical AI principles, such as those
                        articulated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_ethics">AI Ethics Guidelines</a> of
                        major organizations, reinforce the
                        need for inclusivity and fairness in language technologies.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                    <p>Language communities are indispensable partners in advancing equitable and effective Large
                        Language Models. Their participation in documentation, data curation, validation, and feedback
                        mechanisms ensures that LLMs reflect linguistic diversity and cultural richness. Through
                        collaborative efforts involving researchers, policymakers, language activists, technologists,
                        and international institutions, it is possible to mitigate digital inequalities and preserve
                        endangered languages in the era of AI.</p>
