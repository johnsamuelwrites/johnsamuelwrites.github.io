                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>My head turns left on the table, my right cheek pressed against the cool wood
                            surface. Everything here is in messy form—laptop next to me, papers scattered like
                            autumn leaves. The aroma of something wonderful drifts from the kitchen where Mama
                            is preparing lunch, something that smells like home, like love simmered in a pot
                            with its lid dancing slightly from the steam. <span class="stream-thought">I just
                                looked at my belly... it's producing some sound ever since I walked in. I've put
                                on weight since I visited my mother, comfort food and comfort love doing their
                                work.</span></p>

                        <p>Mother entered the room twice already—that familiar sensation of feeling her eyes on
                            me, assessing, worrying, but she walked away both times as if she hadn't seen
                            anything at all. <span class="stream-thought">She knows something is wrong. She
                                can't control herself.</span> She comes back a third time, unable to resist the
                            maternal pull.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"What's the matter?"</span> she asks, her voice soft but
                            insistent.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Nothing... nothing of a big deal,"</span> I mumble, not
                            lifting my head from the table.</p>

                        <p><span class="stream-thought">She knows I'm lying again.</span> <span class="dialogue">"What's
                                the matter? I can see that you are sad."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"MaMama, no big deal. I am fine."</span></p>

                        <p>She gives me that look—the one that says she's known me for decades and
                            can read my soul like her favorite prayer book. <span class="dialogue">"Come on,
                                Iohannes."</span> Now I have no reprieve. I can't hide it from my mom anymore.
                        </p>

                        <p>She cuts her words short when I give her that look—she knows. <span
                                class="stream-thought">That's eleven straight rejections for my book.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"But your last book was a major success! Everyone in the
                                church was talking about it. You know, even Magdalene said that her daughter
                                Rachel loved it."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="stream-thought">I know where this discussion will head to.</span> <span
                                class="dialogue">"Haven't you achieved all that you had hoped for in your
                                childhood? Isn't it enough? Everyone in the church knows you and appreciates
                                your work."</span></p>

                        <p>For my mother, the world revolves around her church and her church friends and what
                            the family members think about chasing dreams. <span class="dialogue">"You have got
                                all that you wanted this time... stop chasing your dreams."</span></p>

                        <p>I give her a very strong look. She gets it and changes the subject, retreating like a
                            cat that's knocked over a vase.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Look, you came to visit me for two weeks, and every time you
                                come, you spend half the time in front of your computer. I don't know what you
                                do there. Did you come here for a vacation to talk to me, or to spend time with
                                that machine?"</span></p>

                        <p>I can sense her sadness beneath the frustration. <span class="dialogue">"Mama, I'm
                                sorry. It's just that I've been waiting for this response for a very long time,
                                and you know that it's like the eleventh rejection. I'm sad. I took this break
                                to get away from it all, but my mind is completely occupied with it. I'm sorry.
                                I want to spend more time with you, to hear all your gossips."</span> I give her
                            a wink.</p>

                        <p>She gives me back a smile, showing all her teeth as if she's auditioning for a
                            toothpaste advertisement. <span class="stream-thought">I guess I inherited this grin
                                from her.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Okay, no more computers from now on."</span></p>

                        <p>I move my hands toward the lid of my laptop to close it, and suddenly—an alert. A new
                            email notification. Mom looks at me curiously. <span class="stream-thought">She
                                doesn't have much of an idea about computers.</span> I know it's a mail
                            notification, and in that split second, I think about the twelfth publisher and
                            wonder whether this could be their response.</p>

                        <p>Mom notices the delay in my decision to close the laptop. She's about to turn back
                            toward the kitchen, trusting me to keep my word. <span class="stream-thought">I
                                could close the computer lid right now. She would smile again, showing her teeth
                                like a victorious person, and I would smile back.</span></p>

                            But sometimes, the universe sends us signs wrapped in electronic notifications,<br>

                            even when everyone tells us to stop chasing them.
