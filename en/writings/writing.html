                <p>I am neither a writer nor a poet and have done no formal studies in literature. I write here just
                    like any other ordinary person expressing my feelings around my life. Hence most of my writings tend
                    to be in first person.

                    I need to say that from time to time, I had adventured into writing, had stopped for a while and
                    then I had restarted. My first experiences with writing come from my school days. I had participated
                    in several story, essay and poem writing competitions.
                    I also had very good encouragement from my teachers. It was also during this time that I came across
                    people who were very good with their words. It seemed to me that words just flow for them when they
                    start writing. And even now, I consider
                    myself nowhere around them. Needless to say, I didn't continue serious writing after a while,
                    keeping aside regular academic assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love reading. As a researcher, I need to read a lot of scientific papers. So reading is also part
                    of my profession. But I think I loved reading ever since my childhood. I try not to restrict myself
                    to just technical books. My reading list includes books
                    from several domains. As I read the works of different authors from different places, especially
                    novels, I love how, by the power of their writing, they are able to give a glimpse of the society
                    where they are living. With words, they
                    guide the readers to build a mental picture of the place of their characters. Quite often, I wonder
                    whether the author had actually lived or travelled to these places or these places are mere
                    imaginations of a society, the author desires
                    to live in (or perhaps wishes to avoid living in). These works also make me realize that thanks to
                    the efforts and some anecdotes, we know a lot about the history of human beings. Some of their
                    viewpoints are subjective, while others factual
                    and can be verified by other measures. There is no doubt that books play a signifantly great role in
                    human culture.

                    Once, I overheard a conversation between two people. One was saying to the other about a recent book
                    he was reading on a particular topic. I don't recall whether it was the topic or the author that
                    made the other person say, <b>"Nowadays, everyone is writing a book"</b>.
                    I paused for a while and reflected on those words. Is it really true that everybody is writing a
                    book these days? Logically speaking, at the very least taking into account some friends around me, I
                    can assure that the above statement is
                    not correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But let's reconsider the above statement once again. Even if we assume that the statement is true,
                    what's really wrong with everybody writing a book. Our future generations will have a great,
                    complete and subjective (possibly even contradictory) account
                    of various events around our lives. People may have an exposition to the writings of other people
                    undergoing similar problems and the actions that they had undertaken to resolve them. They will be
                    sure that they are not the only ones going
                    through a particular problem and there are at least a few others like them, if not many. Also the
                    collective conscience and human culture progress further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had conversations with people from various backgrounds in different places related to many of
                    their seemingly unique issues. Every time, they share their stories, I really pause for a while and
                    ask them why they do not consider writing their experiences.
                    The responses are usually more or less the same. "I don't have time.", "Who's going to read my
                    story?", "It's nothing worthwhile to share", "I will do it one day", "I am not a great writer" etc.
                    to cite a few. I cannot say that I am immune
                    to any of these reasons.
                </p>

                    Some years back, I used to write posts on technology and programming related aspects. Then because
                    of the combined pressure of research and work, I stopped for a while. However, my reading habits did
                    not change. I must add that thanks to many other technological
                    and programming blogs as well as forums, I have been able to resolve many of my technical and
                    research problems. And because of these oft-unknown authors, many like me all are able to progress
                    forward.
                </p>
                When it comes to writing, I also struggle to overcome the issues of procrastination and
                self-undermining. But recently, thanks to the evolving story format<sup><a href="#evolving">1</a></sup>,
                I am able to write more often. I write and then
                rewrite, and yet never lose my valuable thinking process. My oft-incomplete posts calls me back, "You
                need to finish my first draft." But I am no longer pressed as before. I am aware that even my incomplete
                posts are able to recount my half-baked
                thoughts and unfulfilled dreams. I also attempt to <b>adventure writing about topics that I don't
                    know</b>, something that would require me to do a lot more research on them. I can assure you it is
                really interesting and challenging, as they
                say.

                    I started this particular post talking about my background. I suppose that the words that I use on
                    this site are simple, hoping they are able to narrate my version of the story, a story that will
                    remain untold, if not written down. When I take a look
                    at various historical writings, I wonder how hard it would have been for anyone without sufficient
                    means to express their thoughts centuries back, especially before the age of printing machine. Books
                    were hand-written and were available
                    to a few handful. Now we have got the internet and the connectivity around the world has been
                    improving. We often talk about the information age and the associated abundance of information. We
                    seemingly have an opportunity to express our
                    feelings and share with others and possibly to the future generation the anecdotes of our daily
                    lives and struggles. We may try to undermine our own personal blogs with the words <b>"Oh, it's just
                        yet another blog"</b>,
                    but through them, we are not only sharing our experiences with someone among us but also leaving
                    behind a 'legacy' for the future generation.

                    Consider the history of literature of any language, especially poetry. There are (or were, depending
                    upon to whom you are talking) several strict rules guiding the classical poetry. But as humanity
                    advanced, many more came forward experimenting with new
                    formats. They wrote poems that moved beyond those classical rules and yet those poems are able to
                    transfer the poets' emotions and sentiments. This trend can be seen even in other areas like art
                    where some of the artists of classical paintings
                    took great care in achieving accurate representations of their subjects while many artists of the
                    contemporary age use abstract ideas and leave it to the viewer for any further interpretation. My
                    personal opinion is that this trend in
                    art, writing or any other domain has permitted and encouraged more and more people and not just
                    amateurs to come forward and present their works to a much larger audience to get their feedback and
                    obtain tips for improvement. Hence this
                    site is my personal experiment towards the goal of sharing my experiences through the medium of
                    writing (and sometimes, even art as in this article).
