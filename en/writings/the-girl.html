                        <p>It was 7:50 AM. I feared I would be late for the appointment.</p>
                        <p>But something made me pause. Just across the street, a banner fluttered in the
                            morning breeze—faded but defiant. It hung above the bookshop where I had spent so
                            many quiet afternoons. The shop was closing. A few well-wishers had put up the
                            banner in protest, hoping perhaps for a last-minute miracle. Another casualty of the
                            internet economy, I thought.</p>
                        <p>The news stirred something deep in me. That bookshop had been a silent companion over
                            the years. I often bought gifts there—mostly for birthdays, though truthfully, the
                            birthdays were just an excuse. I wanted to be surrounded by pages and ink, by covers
                            and the gentle rustle of paper. And now, it would all disappear. Quietly. Without
                            fanfare. Like the passing of a season.</p>
                        <p>The clock nudged me back into motion. I gave the storefront one last look before
                            heading to my appointment.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>I arrived two minutes early, but the carpool driver— a young woman—was already
                            waiting. I greeted her and introduced myself. Other passengers soon joined us, and
                            we set off.</p>
                        <p>Carpooling brings with it a strange rhythm. Each ride feels familiar yet new. Some
                            riders are shy, others spill their stories like open books. If you use it often, you
                            find yourself repeating the same lines: who you are, what you do, why you ride. But
                            you also hear stories—fragments of lives—that stay with you long after the journey
                            ends.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>Our driver had just graduated and recently started working as a librarian. The
                            coincidence was striking, almost poetic. I couldn’t help my curiosity. I asked her
                            about her work, how they organize the shelves, choose the magazines, decide what
                            books to acquire. Her face lit up with every question—as if she too cherished this
                            quiet world of words.</p>
                        <p>The drive was long, nearly three hours. About halfway through, she suggested a break.
                            We all agreed. We stopped at a rest station, and I treated myself to a warm <em>pain
                                au chocolat</em>.</p>
                        <p>Before continuing, she pulled into a petrol station. We pointed her toward the
                            automated card terminal, but she politely declined. “Cash, if you don’t mind,” she
                            said with a smile. She noted the pump number and drove over to the counter. Inside,
                            a cashier—a woman in her fifties—waited behind a glass panel. The driver handed her
                            the details and paid in coins and bills. The entire transaction took less than three
                            minutes. No one in the car spoke. But we all felt it.</p>
                        <p>She broke the silence. “I just got a job,” she said, as if answering the question on
                            all our minds. “I know how hard it is to find one. If I can do
                            something—anything—that helps someone else keep theirs, I will.”</p>
                        <p>We often say millennials are digital natives—tech-savvy, hyperconnected, allergic to
                            cash. What should I say about this millennial, then?</p>

                        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The bookstore, the cashier, the librarian—threads in a
                            fading tapestry. As algorithms grow louder, we risk losing the quiet gestures that
                            hold our communities together. Not with a crash, but with a hush.</p>
