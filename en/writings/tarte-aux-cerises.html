                <h1>The Cherry Tree Meditation</h1>
                <div class="subtitle">A Journal Entry from an Office Courtyard</div>
                <p>From my third-floor office window,
                    I gaze down into the office courtyard—a small sanctuary of nature within these centuries-old
                    academic walls. The cherry tree that has become my daily contemplation stands transformed. What
                    began as a skeletal winter silhouette,
                    then burst into the pale green promise of early April,
                    has now reached its glorious crescendo. The deep burgundy cherries hang like small jewels against
                    the broad leaves,
                    each one catching the late afternoon light that filters through the arches of the surrounding
                    buildings.</p>
                <p>I have watched this tree through an entire cycle now,
                    since my arrival in this office. In February,
                    during the harsh winds that sweep across the campus,
                    it stood bare and seemingly lifeless. Then came the miracle of spring—tiny buds appearing almost
                    overnight in late March,
                    followed by the delicate white blossoms that carpeted the courtyard stones in early April. The
                    transformation felt like witnessing poetry written in chlorophyll and time. Now,
                    in late June,
                    as cherry season reaches its peak,
                    the tree offers its ultimate gift.</p>
                <p>The afternoon sun illuminates not just the tree,
                    but the small community that has gathered beneath it. I recognize several colleagues.Watching them,
                    I am struck by how this simple act of foraging has created an impromptu community. These are
                    scholars who typically inhabit different intellectual worlds,
                    united by the most fundamental human activity: gathering food from the earth.
                    There is something more primal here,
                    something that connects them to centuries of humans who have stood beneath fruit trees,
                    participating in the ancient rhythm of harvest.</p>
                <div class="section-break">◊ ◊ ◊</div>
                <p>I feel the familiar tug of desire to join them,
                    to leave my manuscript revisions and conference abstracts behind for just a few moments. My current
                    research suddenly seems less urgent than this living laboratory
                    outside my window. Yet I remain tethered to my desk by the weight of academic deadlines
                    and the peculiar inertia that accompanies deep intellectual work.</p>
                <p>There is something almost monastic about academic life,
                    this voluntary isolation in pursuit of knowledge. Yet watching the scene below,
                    I wonder if we sometimes forget that true wisdom might require stepping away from our texts,
                    literally grounding ourselves in the earth that nourishes both body and spirit. The cherry tree
                    offers its fruit to anyone willing to bend down and gather it.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow,
                    I tell myself. Surely there will still be cherries. Surely this
                    moment of community will wait for my scholarly obligations to be fulfilled. I manage to resist the
                    impulse to abandon my work,
                    but not without a strange sense that I am choosing the shadow over the substance,
                    the description over the experience.</p>
                <div class="section-break">◊ ◊ ◊</div>
                <p>The next morning arrives with that particular quality of light that signals summer's full
                    arrival in our region. I arrive early,
                    before most of my colleagues,
                    and immediately look toward the courtyard. The cherry tree stands there,
                    serene and majestic as always,
                    but something has changed. The ground beneath it,
                    which yesterday was dotted with fallen fruit,
                    is completely clean. Not a single cherry remains—not on the branches,
                    which I can see have been carefully picked,
                    nor scattered on the ancient cobblestones below.</p>
                <p>At first,
                    I experience a peculiar sense of loss,
                    as if I have missed not just the cherries but some essential lesson they were meant to teach. The
                    courtyard seems strangely quiet,
                    lacking the gentle laughter and collegial chatter that had provided a soundtrack to yesterday's
                    harvest. I think of all the moments I have observed from this window—students
                    reading beneath the tree in early spring,
                    professors taking coffee breaks in its shade,
                    groundskeepers carefully tending the soil around its roots. Each of these interactions now seems
                    part of a larger choreography I have been watching but not truly participating in.</p>
                <p>But then,
                    sitting with my morning café and contemplating this sense of missed opportunity,
                    I begin to understand something deeper. The cherries had not simply vanished—they had fulfilled
                    their purpose. They had brought together a community,
                    provided nourishment,
                    created connections between people who might otherwise pass each other with merely polite nods in
                    the corridors. The tree had orchestrated a moment of shared humanity,
                    and I had been privileged to witness it,
                    even from a distance.</p>
                <p>Perhaps my role was not to participate directly but to observe and reflect—to be the chronicler of
                    these small but significant moments that make up the true life of an academic community. As a
                    scholar of literature,
                    I am accustomed to finding meaning in the stories others tell. Now I wonder if the story I have been
                    watching unfold has been telling itself all along,
                    waiting for someone with the patience to see it whole.</p>
                <div class="section-break">◊ ◊ ◊</div>
                <p>Just as I am settling into this philosophical acceptance of yesterday's missed opportunity,
                    my computer chimes with the distinctive sound of office email. The sender is Madame Marie-Claude,
                    our departmental secretary,
                    and the subject line reads simply: "Tarte aux
                    cerises." My pulse quickens with curious anticipation as I click to open the message.</p>

                <p>The email is brief but transformative: the cherries gathered yesterday by the various faculty members
                    have been combined and transformed into a collaborative dessert. A tarte aux cerises awaits in the
                    faculty lounge,
                    available for all colleagues to share throughout the afternoon. Madame Marie-Claude's message
                    includes a
                    gentle note that several faculty members
                    specifically hoped their colleague "who watches from the third floor" would join them.
                </p>
                <p>I find myself smiling—genuinely,
                    deeply smiling—in a way that surprises me. The realization that I have been observed observing,
                    that my position at the window has made me part of the community rather than separate from it,
                    fills me with an unexpected warmth. The cherries have found their way to me after all,
                    transformed through the alchemy of community cooperation into something even more nourishing than
                    individual fruit.</p>
                <p>Rising from my desk, I prepare to descend those three flights of stairs.
                    Outside my window,
                    the cherry tree stands peaceful in the morning light,
                    its branches lighter now but somehow more graceful,
                    ready to begin the quiet work of next year's cycle. And I am ready, finally, to join the
                    conversation that has been waiting
                    for me all along.</p>
