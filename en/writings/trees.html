            <p>
                Albert Einstein once said, while studying the laws governing the universe:
            </p>
            <cite>
                God does not place dice with the universe.
            </cite>
            <p>
                This is exactly my feeling when I look at the trees.
                I marvel them every time that I see them.
                Everytime, I feel that they are narrating a new story, their story of being near us and yet their
                branches far away from our reaches.
                And we look up, admiring the intricate mingling of branches and leaves, the litte gaps by which they let
                the light pass through, thereby eradicating the possible darkness that their leaves would have created,
                if left unsurveilled.
                The trees allowing those light rays for us, us, those under their shade, the living beings including the
                smaller plants.
                So majestic and glorios, yet generous.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's the secret behind their beauty?
                There are numerous kinds of trees, some large, and some small, some tall and some wide.
                Yet each one of them is beautiful.
                You try to decipher their beauty.
                You sense some repitition in their marvelous character.
                You feel the pattern by which they grow.
                Is it beacuase we, humans always look for finding meaning and understanding everything around us?
                I have no response.
                Understanding all the different patterns in nature is impossible.
                But, I assume that it is because of those patterns that I love admiring them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most often, we see the part that grows out of the soil.
                Yet, those beautiful patterns of branches are somehow repeated underground through roots.
                Is it possible to call this the symmetry of nature?
                A symmetry manifested below and above the ground.
                There are innumerable trees around the world which are older than me and might have witnessed several
                historical events.
                They may have some hidden stories to tell.
                So many people pass under their shade daily.
                They might have quietly sensed our ongoing emotions, but act as emotionless spectators.
                Here, comes the breeze, then, a strong wind, and the leaves rattle.
                And I called them emotionless!
            </p>
            <p>
                Some, like me, look up to cherish the beautiful shade formed by their leaves to protect us, humans from
                the scorching heat.
                What's their mystery?
                My curious mind always look for answers.
                Growing up, I learned about the fractals.
                Some, simple rules, repeated almost infinitely, creating inexplicable beauty.
                Is Nature using some simple rules to create this beauty?
                Manifesting their diversity by just following some simple rules.
                They have been studied for centuries and many of the rules that bind them still remain a secret.
                They were also not spared by Leonardo da Vinci, the artist, but also a curious mind also studied them
                and documented rules related to cross-sectional area of trees and their branches.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the way they grow, the way their intricate branches spread out, as if they are searching for
                something in this world and they are trying to grasp it with those branches.
                Across the seasons, they stand strong, answering to the rules of nature in different ways.
                I love observing and photographing these responses, demonstrated by their growth from almost nothing
                like a bud to leaves and branches in the spring, the cool shade by the leaves during the summer, the
                palette of colors by the leaves felt during the autumn, and a return back to a leafless spectator during
                the winter.
                But it's during the winter season, I feel the most the rules of nature when see the complex beauty of
                branches hidden under those leaves, those patterns of branching repeating from the trunk to the twigs.
