                    <section>
                        <p><strong>Salü bisàmme!</strong> (Salut tout le monde / Hello everyone), as they say in the
                            Alsatian language.</p>
                        <p>This was my third <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCamp_2025">Wikicamp</a>, and
                            this time it took place in the vibrant, multicultural city of Strasbourg. I had previously
                            attended the editions in Narbonne and Saint-Malo. As someone deeply engaged with Wikimedia
                            Commons, Wikidata, and Wikipedia, I always treat these gatherings as an opportunity to both
                            learn and contribute — and also to rediscover the cities that host us through a Wikimedia
                            lens.</p>
                        <p>I arrived early in the morning and headed straight to the city center. My day began, quite
                            fittingly, with a pain au chocolat and a cappuccino — a welcome change from my usual
                            black coffee. Not far away stood the magnificent <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg_Cathedral">Strasbourg Cathedral</a>.
                            Although I had seen it on earlier visits, this was the first time I truly had time to
                            explore it in depth — both as a visitor and as a Commons photographer.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>After breakfast, I wandered through Strasbourg’s charming historical streets. Every building
                            seemed to tell a story. The architectural details — especially the windows and carvings —
                            captivated me. As a photographer and Commons contributor, I always find myself facing the
                            same joyful dilemma: which photo should I take? People often say, “Everything’s already been
                            photographed,” but that’s never how I feel. There’s always a new angle, a detail someone
                            overlooked, or a shadow that shifts just right. That’s why I often return from these trips
                            with hundreds of photographs — and a sense of having witnessed something new each time.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, I made my way to the Cathedral. The pink sandstone, the intricate sculptures
                            — I lost track of time just standing there, absorbing it all. I circled around to the
                            southern side and arrived at <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Cath%C3%A9drale,_Strasbourg">Place de
                                la Cathédrale</a>, where the architectural rhythm of the façades and the ornate doors
                            drew my full attention.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>Later, I walked down to the river. The bridges were adorned with flower pots, casting
                            colorful reflections onto the water — it brought back nostalgic memories of <a

                            The weather was bright and the city looked radiant. I paused at every turn to photograph the
                            historic buildings mirrored in the river’s surface. Among the churches I passed was the
                            beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas%27_Church,_Strasbourg">Église
                                Saint-Thomas</a>.</p>
                        <p>Pressed for time but still eager to explore, I opted for a boat cruise through the historic
                            parts of the city. It turned out to be a perfect decision. From the water, I could admire
                            many landmarks in a short span — including an impressive lock system that lifted our boat as
                            the chamber filled with water. This engineering marvel brought us to <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Petite_France">La Petite France</a>, a
                            picturesque district that has inspired many films. I was mesmerized by its charm.
                            After the boat ride, I stopped for lunch and tried the famous Alsatian dish
                            <em>choucroute</em>. As I was leaving the
                            restaurant, I spotted a group of Wikimedians arriving. I exchanged a few words with familiar
                            faces and promised to meet them later.

                        <p>After lunch, I explored La Petite France on foot. Walking allowed me to appreciate the
                            timber-framed houses even more closely — their geometry like a textbook of vernacular
                            mathematics. I soon reached the <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Rohan,_Strasbourg">Ponts Couverts</a>,
                            where the reflections of the iconic towers danced on the surface of the water. I was
                            fortunate to visit the interior of <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune_Protestant_Church">Église
                                protestante Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune</a>. Its vibrant frescoes and peaceful cloisters
                            offered a moment of calm. I stayed there for a while, soaking in the silence,
                            letting dreams drift through the arches.</p>

                        <p>Later, I reached the Wikicamp venue via public transport. Seeing everyone gathered was
                            heartwarming. Some participants I had seen just weeks earlier at the <a
                                href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_sans_pagEs">Les sans pagEs</a> convention in
                            Lyon. That evening’s dinner gave us a beautiful chance to reconnect and share stories from
                            our corners of the movement.</p>
                        <p>The following two days were filled with inspiring talks, workshops, and collaborative
                            moments. One particularly thought-provoking workshop focused on ethics and conflict of
                            interest. Participants broke into groups to discuss how the Wikimedia movement could evolve
                            while staying rooted in core principles. </p>
                        <p>One of the most compelling sessions addressed <strong>detecting biases in AI-generated
                                text</strong>. Organized by <a
                                href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikim%C3%A9dia_France">Wikimédia France</a>, the
                            discussion examined the challenges artificial intelligence presents to Wikipedia’s <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">Neutral Point of
                                View</a>. It was reassuring to witness the community proactively building tools and
                            awareness to ensure editorial integrity. </p>
                        <p>A dedicated session also introduced <strong>Wikimania 2026</strong>, which will take place
                            next year in Paris. The presentation highlighted its significance as a global gathering that
                            will bring together Wikimedians from all over the world to celebrate, debate, and shape the
                            future of free knowledge — this time in the heart of France.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>One of my favorite parts of Wikicamp was the guided walking tour — thankfully not the typical
                            tourist path. We revisited the Cathedral and explored the <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Rohan,_Strasbourg">Palais Rohan</a>, its
                            adjacent museums, and several charming old hotels. We passed by the <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academic_Library_(Strasbourg)">Bibliothèque
                                nationale et universitaire</a>, discussing Strasbourg’s cultural heritage and exploring
                            its public transport systems.</p>
                        <p> I also
                            visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_William%27s_Church,_Strasbourg">Église
                                Saint-Guillaume</a>, an inclusive and welcoming church I hadn't planned on visiting but
                            felt drawn to. It flew a rainbow flag (LGBTI+ flag) — something I hadn't expected but
                            appreciated deeply.
                            I took the opportunity to photograph and document it for Wikimedia Commons.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the most moving moments came during the closing ceremony, when we learned more about
                            the local community’s work on the <a href="https://als.wikipedia.org/">Alsatian-language
                                Wikipedia</a>. Their dedication to preserving regional knowledge and identity through
                            collaborative editing was both humbling and inspiring. It reminded me that Wikimedia is
                            truly a multilingual, multicultural movement — and that every voice matters.</p>

                        <p>As Wikicamp 2025 came to an end, I felt immensely grateful. Each Wikicamp leaves a lasting
                            mark. In Narbonne, I discovered the beauty of the incomplete Cathédrale
                            Saint-Just-et-Saint-Pasteur and one of its bas-reliefs with vivid depictions of hell —
                            reminiscent of Dante’s nine
                            circles of the Inferno. In Saint-Malo, I stood by the sea and witnessed the dramatic tides,
                            the <em>haut-mer</em> and <em>bas-mer</em>, and felt the power of nature rise above our
                            heads.</p>
                        <p>And in Strasbourg, I was moved by the local Wikimedia community’s efforts to safeguard
                            linguistic heritage, and by the quiet resilience of inclusive religious spaces. These days
                            were filled with learning, exploring, connecting, and contributing — all pillars of the
                            Wikimedia mission. Strasbourg’s blend of history, architecture, and community made this
                            Wikicamp truly unforgettable.</p>
                        <p>Until next time — and until the next contribution.</p>
