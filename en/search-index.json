Though it was a small role, I still recall the importance played by the character. Why theatre? I wished to experiment with different activities and theatre was one such activity for which I never had any formal initial training.

Two of which are synonyms and antonyms. Where synonyms can be used to find similar words for a particular word, antonyms, in contrast, give you a word with the opposite meaning. And the way by antonym works is interesting. One feels that the languages assume an underlying duality. Duality may be referred to as binary choices, where everything can be limited to yes or no questions. When some statement is not affirmative, we may need to find another way to say it in the affirmative, and antonyms come into the picture. \"Is this not hot?\" can be rephrased as \"Is this cold?\". Hot and cold, day and night, dawn and dusk, good and bad, long and short, etc., are some words coupled with their antonyms. One may get the impression ",

But sometimes, your efforts to communicate using languages may end in vain. Then you try to use something you believe is a universal human language: signs and gestures. You try to use some signs, gestures, and even mimicking sounds to communicate your idea. It may seem that these signs are universal, but sometimes they aren't.

Learning becomes significantly difficult when the new language has a different script from the languages we already know. But can language learning be made simpler?

Looking back, I feel that it is hard to compartmentalize colors under certain names if we are not precise about all the possible values for a given color name. I suppose the first time I questioned about technical aspects of colors was when I learned about them in my textbook related to computer graphics.

Documentation-driven Development to be clear, is not aimed to replace test-driven development but rather augment this approach.

But the consequence of subscribing to a large number of feeds is waste of time, especially when it requires skimming through a multitude of irrelevant and redundant articles. Many of the current desktop feed aggregators don't have options to filter out the articles based on the past reading profile and to group similar articles from multiple sites. A reading profile can be built by analysis of the articles read in the past and their associated tags (e.g., important, read-later).

Introduction As algorithmic systems become deeply embedded in modern life—from social media feeds and credit scoring to job recruitment and healthcare—questions of transparency, fairness, and individual rights have taken center stage. One key demand emerging from this ethical and legal conversation is the right to explanation : the right of individuals to understand, question, and contest algorithmic decisions that affect their lives. Although rooted in legal frameworks like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the right to explanation is also a social, ethical, and technical imperative.

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) Fibonacci Numbers: A Mathematical Journey Across Nature, Art, and Science Fibonacci Numbers Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The sequence unfolds as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: F(n) = F(n−1) + F(n−2), with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1 The sequence is named after Leonardo Bonacci , known as Fibonacci, a 13th-century Italian mathematician who popularized these numbers in his groundbreaking work Liber Abaci (1202).

It is considered both a science and an art due to its mathematical underpinnings and emotional impact. How Music Differs from Noise Noise is generally defined as irregular, chaotic, or unwanted sound. In contrast, music involves structured sound with intentional organization. However, this distinction can be subjective and culturally relative. For instance, certain avant-garde genres incorporate elements traditionally considered noise (e.g., musique concrète ). Or",

Yet in 2025, as large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate between users and information, the visibility of human-created sources like Wikipedia is quietly diminishing. When AI chatbots summarize, paraphrase, or rewrite content originally curated by human editors, readers may never visit the underlying pages. The result is measurable: a decline in human pageviews, and potentially, a decline in the shared engagement that sustains Wikimedia projects. \"We are seeing declines in human pageviews on Wikipedia over the past few months, amounting to a decrease of roughly 8% compared to the same months in 2024.\" Diff , 17 October 202",

The struggle for survival has often shown us the paths rarely taken as well as the advantages and the risks associated with them. What is imagination?

No Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, or even niche networks. It wasn't a dramatic exit. There was no farewell post. Just a quiet and deliberate choice to disconnect, reflect, and reclaim control over how I communicate, what I share, and how I relate to others online.

During this pursuit, I came across Perl's inspiring phrase, \"There's more than one way to do it,\" often represented by the acronym 'TMTOWTDI.' [2] It's vital to understand that TMTOWTDI transcends a single programming language. We can observe its presence in our surroundings, from the immediate to the far-reaching. However, it's not solely about the myriad ways we accomplish tasks; it extends beyond mere actions. We act, think, sing, read, write, and speak differently. For reasons unknown, nature has endowed us with this inherent diversity in how we live. Nonetheless, diversity extends beyond our individual abilities; it's a fundamental principle evident in the studies of physics and biology, where numerous simple laws underlie the vast array of natural phenomena.

A standing eulogy, an eulogy that I couldn't make. I do not know the answer yet. Whenever I think about you, the vacant chair and the stick of grandmother comes to my mind. I picture myself sitting opposite to the chair and staring at it. I try to recall the numerous discussions that I had with you. You waking up early in the morning, coming out of the house with your glass of hot tea and searching for the newspaper to finally sit on your chair and start reading.

The familiar rhythm of her household had already begun to reclaim me, though I wasn't entirely ready to surrender to it. I woke late that summer morning to the house already filled with the rich aromas of her cooking—a medley of spices and baking that spoke of preparations for something special. The kitchen was alive with activity when I finally emerged from my room, still rubbing sleep from my eyes. Pots simmered on the stove, and I could see she was in the middle of preparing what looked like an elaborate meal. Her movements were purposeful, practiced, the dance of someone who had orchestrated countless family gatherings. \"I need you to go to the grocery store,\" she announced without looking up from her work, wiping her hands on the apron tied around her waist. \"I'm m",

However, the touch of Homo sapiens is not confined to physical artifacts. It is time to focus our attention to protect and preserve other traces of human heritage beyond confining ourselves to two of our major senses: touch and sight.

Yet even with the richness of colored illustrations, something essential remained unexpressed: the true spatial nature of the objects being depicted. Project 3D represents the logical progression from these foundational explorations.

These lessons have fundamentally shaped my approach to creating art with SVG and Inkscape, revealing the intricate relationship between memory, observation, and digital creation. The Illusion of Complete Memory I initially thought I knew the objects and their details intimately before attempting to draw them. However, the act of drawing itself revealed how incomplete my mental images truly were. I found it necessary to cross-check with real photographs for minute details—discovering that memory often captures essence rather than precision. This realization taught me humility and the importance of careful observation. The Value of Manual Tracing While working on a s",

What some might dismiss as \"naive\" or \"simplistic\" drawings, these individuals saw as something worth nurturing and celebrating. Their words of encouragement have been invaluable. When doubt crept in, when I questioned whether these simple lines and shapes held any meaning, it was their feedback that reminded me of the value in continuing this journey. They saw beyond technical perfection to recognize the authenticity , the storytelling , and the personal expression embedded in each drawing.

At its core, this project revolves around SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), a format often associated with crisp and precise visual representations. However, in my quest to recapture life's memories, SVG becomes more than just a file format—it transforms into a vessel for storytelling and self-expression .

What began as simple line work demanded chromatic expression, transforming black and white compositions into vibrant memories painted with personal palettes. This project became an exploration of dimensionality —moving from pure 2D representations toward perspective drawing techniques that create 3D perceptions through carefully applied chromatic depth and spatial color relationships. Most fundamentally, it became an exploration of light itself —understanding how light transforms color, how shadows add depth, how gradients suggest volume, and how strategic color placement can evoke the interplay of illumination and surface that defines our visual experience of the world.

This project emerged organically when I began creating realistic images without color as part of Project Drawing . Gradually, I found myself experimenting with gradients of black to remain in the monochrome world, yet something was missing. I felt a growing need for a separate project where I could revisit some of my finished drawings and create dedicated color versions, breathing new chromatic life into familiar forms. Thus Project Color was born—sharing the same foundation of exploring vector art with SVG and Inkscape, but this time embracing the full spectrum of color. \"Color is not just decoration—it is memory, emotion, and the essence of how we experience the world around us.\"",

Starting from zero knowledge of color theory, I embarked on a systematic learning journey. Each colored drawing became both a finished piece and a documented learning moment, tracked meticulously through version control.
