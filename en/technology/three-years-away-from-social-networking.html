                <h3>Three Years Away from Social Media: A Personal Reflection on Digital Boundaries and Rediscovery</h3>
                <p>Some years ago, I made the decision to leave social media behind—and stayed away for nearly three
                    years (2 years and 10 months, to be precise)—stepping away consciously from all social networking
                    platforms. No Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
                    Instagram, or even niche networks. It wasn't a dramatic exit. There was no farewell post. Just a
                    quiet and deliberate choice to disconnect, reflect, and reclaim control over how I communicate, what
                    I share, and how I relate to others online.</p>
                <h3>Leaving the Stream: Why I Disconnected</h3>
                <p>At the time, my reasons were both personal and professional. I felt a growing discomfort with the
                    blur between public and private, professional and personal. Sharing updates, photos, and thoughts
                    had become reflexive. The lines between audiences—friends, colleagues, acquaintances, even
                    strangers—were indistinct. I missed the ability to curate who sees what, a concept I once
                    appreciated in Google+ Circles, which allowed nuanced group-based sharing. Unfortunately, most
                    current platforms have abandoned that granularity in favor of broader, algorithm-driven engagement
                    models.</p>
                <p>Another factor was the increasingly overwhelming flow of content: opinions, arguments, breaking news,
                    fake news, likes, shares, outrage, comparison, FOMO. The very nature of these platforms, with their
                    infinite scroll and attention-maximizing design, left me feeling depleted rather than connected. I
                    wanted to be present with my own thoughts, to focus on meaningful conversations, research, travel,
                    and personal development—without the echo chamber constantly humming in the background.</p>
                <h3>Digital Silence: Life Without Social Media</h3>
                <p>The silence that followed was, at first, unfamiliar. No notifications. No tagged photos. No
                    algorithmically curated feeds. But over time, this absence became a source of clarity. I reconnected
                    with people more intentionally—through email, phone calls, video chats, and in-person meetings.
                    These interactions felt deeper and more human than any comment thread or emoji reaction.</p>
                <p>Without the performative layer of online presence, I found more space for reflection. I also
                    discovered that social networking is not the only way to stay informed or inspired. Books, art
                    exhibitions, museums, travels, meetups, and personal blogs entered or re-entered my life. I had the
                    mental bandwidth to engage
                    with them thoughtfully.</p>
                <p>I also began thinking about data—my data. What I shared, who had access to it, and what I wanted to
                    preserve. I started experimenting with a more structured form of self-documentation using open web
                    standards. I created personal web pages in HTML, stored and versioned using Git, to track elements
                    of my life: the films I watched, museums I visited, countries I explored. It became a form of
                    private journaling that gave me ownership and historical perspective—without needing to perform or
                    compete for attention.</p>
                <h3>Rejoining the Stream: What’s Changed?</h3>
                <p>Then, I returned back to social networking—not out of nostalgia, but curiosity. What had changed in
                    these years of absence? On the surface, not much. The platforms look sleeker, and some privacy
                    settings have been updated, though often hidden in deeper layers of configuration. But
                    fundamentally, the core mechanisms remain the same: engagement-driven design, shallow privacy
                    segmentation, data centralization, and a steady undercurrent of noise.</p>
                <p>Yet, I came back with a clearer sense of purpose and boundaries. I now use different platforms for
                    different types of communication. Professional updates go to my website. Personal photos and stories
                    are shared more selectively. I avoid infinite scrolls and mute keywords liberally. Most importantly,
                    I remind myself that I’m not obliged to respond instantly, post constantly, or participate in every
                    digital trend.</p>
                <h3>Decentralization and Self-Data: Toward More Conscious Digital Presence</h3>
                <p>One key shift in my thinking has been toward decentralization. Recently, I started exploring
                    platforms like Mastodon and the broader Fediverse—spaces built on principles of federation and data
                    ownership.
                    Unlike traditional, centralized social networks, these platforms give users greater control over
                    their communities, content, and identities.</p>
                <p>What appeals to me in these models is the return of autonomy. No single company harvests or sells
                    your attention. Communities are smaller, more focused, and often more civil. It’s a quieter
                    internet, and in many ways, a more human one. Diaspora was one of the early pioneers of this vision,
                    and although it didn’t reach mass adoption, its ideas persist in newer federated technologies.</p>
                <p>This connects to my evolving philosophy of self-data: using open tools and formats to track and
                    curate personal information, instead of handing it over to opaque platforms. Whether it's a list of
                    books read, films watched, or memories from travels, I now store these in my own digital space. It’s
                    not about retreating from the web, but about redefining my relationship with it.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion: A More Intentional Online Life</h3>
                <p>Social networking isn’t inherently bad. It can connect us, inform us, and empower us. But it can also
                    distract, distort, and drain us. My time away helped me reset my boundaries, reassess my values, and
                    return with a more intentional mindset. I now approach these platforms as tools—not lifestyles—and
                    use them mindfully, with purpose and restraint.</p>
                <p>In an age of algorithmic everything, reclaiming a bit of digital sovereignty feels not just radical,
                    but necessary. The goal isn’t to disappear—it’s to choose where, how, and why we show up.</p>
