      <h2>Structured Content</h2>
      <p>
        What is structured content?
        There may be multiple responses depending on the audience.
      </p>
      <h3>Human Readability</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start with a use case, where our target audience is human readers.
        In this case, the goal of structured content<sup><a href="#structured-content">1</a></sup> is to ensure
        <b>placement of content in a predictable manner</b>.
        That is, the reader knows fully well where to find the headings,  menu, menu items, sidebars, footer, main
        content
        etc.
        A site following uniform site-wide experience or a magazine following a uniform writing style ensures that the
        reader can directly look or find the desired section at a predictable place.
        The concept of structured content is not limited to the online space, but can also be found on the physical
        space.
        Some of us who still read the print media know those regular places of page numbers, magazine names, issue
        number and year etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever wondered, how the authors of these articles, especially freelancers and independent journalists had managed
        to easily write to all these different medias.
        If we ask tte creator of such articles on how they decide where to place a given section, they may
        respond that they use article or book/magazine template provided by the site owners or publishers.
        Most of the times, they have to focus only on the article content and not on the magazine style.
        There are several ways by which uniform reader or creator experience can be ensured.
        <b>Providing templates</b> for slides, documents, articles, blogs etc. is one such commonly used approach.
        The template users know where to place images, sections, footnotes, references etc.
        Templates ensure uniform font styles and sizes for titles, headings of sections and subsections.
        These skeletons of the structured content guarantee that the readers and content creators
        need to focus only their work and not be worried about
        being distracted or managing the style of a document, blogpost or a newspaper article.
      </p>
      <h3>Partial Machine Readability</h3>
      <p>
        It's not just humans who read our blog articles and web pages.
        Web crawlers navigiate our websites and <b>robots 'read' our content</b> for the purpose of indexation and
        supporting search engine queries.
        Thus machine-readability has also become the focus for the template builders, letting these robots understand
        and distinguish between sidebar and article content, which is visually simple for the humans.
        Now therefore, if we turn our attention to the developers, the term 'structured content' may mean something
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most of them, <b>structured content could mean JSON</b> (or XML some years ago) that can be used to create
        the templates for storing and exchanging data in a manner that machines could easily 'read'.
        Machine-readability means that machines could understand what's present in a file or on a web page.
        Having said that, structured content in developer space does not simply mean the use of JSON or XML.
        There are several other data formats like CSV, HTML, YAML or markdown that exist to ensure proper structure to
        data.
        Nevertheless, the use of such data formats is indeed the first step.
        Some of the above data formats also come with the way to guarantee homogeneous representation of the complete
        data.
        Nevertheless, structuring the data is just a partial attempt to machine-readability.
        Machines may not still understand the content, what do these random strings represent, countries, personsal
        names, dates etc.
      </p>
      <p>This partial machine-readability, though has got advantagges, compared to that of using simply unstructured
        data like the paragraph of a text.
        <b>Programs can communicate with each other</b> easily.
        The output of one program can be used as input to another program.
        On the command line, this is usally done by piping.
        Personally, while programming, I make use of multiple tools and applications.
        Thanks to the structured content, I can easily export the data of one application that can be later exported to
        another program for further analysis and visualisation.
        My own experiments with the command line though show some limitations.
        Many of the current applications make use of tabular format, which are useful for human comprehension, but not
        for other programs.
        Tabular formatting, usually removes part of the content from every column for fitting the output to the user
        screen.
        Piping of output from one program to another often requires text pre-processing to detect such issues.
        Going forward, I believe that programs must assume the usage of the data produced by them will be consumed by
        other applications.
        Hence, <b>tools and applications must have the options to export and import data in the form of structured
          content</b>.
      </p>
      <p>There are several advantages of using the structured content.
        The application output can be easily validated and verified to check some errors are present.
        Human and other programs can make use of different data formatting and stylesheets to visualize it.
        Take for example, changing the look of HTML page with different CSS stylesheets.
        <b>Separation of structure and style</b> is therefore very important.
        Programmers cannot asssume that only humans will consume the data.
        As a developer, it's quite usual to start testing simple messages on the screen, making use of tabular formats
        for human consumption as well as visualization.
        But as software becomes stable and more users start using a software, it is equality important to provide
        interfaces that contain structured content.
      </p>
      <p>
        What should be a common standard for structuring the data?
        The answer depends on your usecase and the programming expertise.
        Standards like XML, JSON, HTML to a certain extent are both human readable and machine-readable.
        Data using these standards are parseable by many existing tools and libraries.
        Most programming lanaguages have libraries for formatting (indenting), validating, pre-processing and
        transforming them.
      </p>
      <h3>Full Machine Readability</h3>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, as mentioned above, these formats in their classical forms are not fully comprehensible by
        machines.
        That's why many recent application develpers may refer to them as semi-structured data formats.
        They are capable in provide homogeneity to the user data.
        However, machines may not be able to distinguish between the different sections of the data, the purpose and
        contents of each data snippet.
        Some of these data formats ensure human-readability, but they were not fully designed
        to ensure complete machine-readability.
        Thus, there is a neeed to give meaning or add semantics to the content.
      </p>

      <h2>Multiple Templates and Data Interoperability</h2>
      <p>multiple templates, need for standardization<sup><a href="#structured-content-evolution">3</a></sup></p>
      <h2>Game Changer</h2>
      <p>
        schema.org<sup><a href="#structured-content-evolution">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples: wikidata<sup><a href="#wikidata">2</a></sup>. Open, multilingual, free, collaborative, linked,
        structured. previously, infoboxes were used for extracting structured data from wikipedia.
        A major limitation, however was that you need to know associated property names in various human languages.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Should the application from the very beginning be driven by structured content.
        I think so.
        But if you start developing an application with a simple proof of concept, it may be a little difficult to
        active such an application development.
