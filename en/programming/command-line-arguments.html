                        Command-line interface is one of the oldest, yet commonly used human-computer interface, where
                        users type textual commands with arguments to get desired results.
                        Developers often provide command-line options for software applications along with graphical
                        user interface.
                        Several programming languages provide standard libraries to help programmers parse and handle
                        command-line arguments.
                        However, both CLI and libraries have evolved all these years, standardizing the way how commands
                        are built and adding along with new functionalities like the use of colors, auto-completion,
                        auto-correction etc.
                        Yet there is a lot of scope for improvement, notably for creating a multilingual interface,
                        obtaining the progress of a command, furthering the use of colors etc.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Considering the recent advances in human-computer interfaces with graphical user interfaces,
                    availability of new devices like mouse, joystick, support for voice commands, recent arrival of new
                    technologies to understand motion gestures, it is easier to
                    say that the command line interface (CLI)<sup><a href="#command-line-interface">1</a></sup> has lost
                    its relevance and charm. CLI can be considered as one of the oldest human-computer interface, where
                    you type in some textual
                    commands and the computer responds with a result. But it is still commonly used by developers and
                    adminstrators even though many commands have their equivalent graphical interface counterpart. CLI
                    is not here to go<sup><a href="#next-ui">7</a></sup>.
                    Modern Programming languages continue to provide libraries to standardize command creation and help
                    developers parse command line arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A look at Unix/Linux command line tools, we notice that most of these commands are abbreviations of
                    their longer forms associated to a key functionality. The word chosen for the functionality usually
                    comes from English. Take for example, Unix/Linux command
                    <code>ls</code> is an abbreviation of <i>list</i> and its main function is to list files in a given
                    directory. Commands may take arguments and they may have an associated shorter and longer version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>ls -s</code>
                </p>
                <p> or
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>ls --size</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    lists the contents of a directory with additional information: file size. Shorter version of an
                    argument (in general) starts with one hyphen (-) and the associated longer version with two hyphens
                    (--). Once again, in most cases, the arguments usually
                    comes from English for the corresponding functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Command-line or terminal commands, hereafter referred to as simply commands require to be memorized
                    and if you are a regular CLI user, it may not be difficult. The learning curve for a novice is
                    however hard, especially the users from non-English background.
                    However, there are manuals and can even be accessed from the command line like <code> $ man </code>
                    or <code> $ info </code>. Nevertheless, CLI requires memorization of commands and their arguments.
                    Even then, this initial
                    curve does not stop new users and many recent programming and development tools have command line
                    options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is CLI still relevant in this age of voice commands and motion gestures? It depends to whom you are
                    asking the question? However the question still remains: can command line be made friendlier to a
                    new user, irrespective of their daily (human) language
                    of use? Can it be made more humane<sup><a href="#feature">4</a></sup> and natural language friendly?
                    Do we really need to remember all those commands and their arguments? For many years, we see the
                    trend towards making
                    CLI human-friendly; auto-completion and auto-corrections have made their entry to several shells.
                    Search engines have raised the bar for textual-based applications.
                    <code> $ man -k 'search term'</code> may suggest several commands related to the search term. It
                    still requires a lot of human effort to find the right set of commands and related arguments for a
                    given task. Therefore, CLI still needs
                    a lot of enhancements. In the debate between GUI icons and commands<sup><a
                            href="#feature">4</a></sup>, it is said that an image can speak thousand words, but it
                    cannot easily replace the word (or command).
                </p>
                <h3>Understanding Command Line Arguments</h3>
                <p>
                    Those familiar with C programming language may have heard about <code>getopt()</code>, a library
                    function for parsing command line arguments with several variants like <code>getopt_long()</code>.
                    Programming languages like Python<sup><a href="#python-getopt">3</a></sup> have functions with the
                    similar name. A command may take several options like <code>-s</code> or <code>--size</code> seen
                    above. Every option has a longer or shorter version and the shorter version is usually the first
                    character of the
                    longer version. Shorter version of an option start with <code>-</code>, where as its longer version
                    starts with <code>--</code>. An option may or may not take additional argument and may suppose some
                    default value, provided by the developer
                    if none is passed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, newer methods like Python's <code>argparse()</code><sup><a
                            href="#python-argparse">2</a></sup> have further enhanced handling of command line arguments
                    like an option may take one or more arguments, ability to specify the expected
                    data type of arguments (e.g. float, integer etc.), easier handling of help messages (e.g.,
                    <code>ls --help</code> for different options. Another interesting feature is the support for
                    subcommands like <code>git</code><sup><a href="#next-ui">10</a></sup> has several subcommands
                    <code>push, pull, commit</code> etc, each having its own set of options sharing the same names (both
                    longer and shorter versions).
                    <code>argparse()</code> has also added the possibility to group arguments (by default, optional and
                    positional arguments are separated) and to permit only one of the options from a group. Groups
                    permit to view the available options separated
                    by their key functionality instead of viewing all available options in an alphabetical order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such functions tend to uniformize the way command line arguments can be handled. The use of such
                    library functions is useful to both users and application developers. Nevertheless, command lines
                    can still be further enhanced.
                </p>
                <h3>Enhancing Command Line</h3>
                <p>
                    An important question is how to further <b>reduce the learning curve</b> of new users to command
                    line, i.e., a way to go beyond the need to memorize commands and their various options. But textual
                    interface is not just confined to command
                    line. Several desktop applications and web services have textual interfaces. Search engines do not
                    expect a lot of expertise from the end users; users type their search query to find desired
                    information. Last several years have seen the
                    growing trend towards graphical user interface and some works have shown how command-line driven
                    systems can be transformed to web applications<sup><a
                            href="#command-line-web-applications">5</a></sup>, binary components<sup><a
                            href="#command-line-components">6</a></sup>,
                    GUI
                    <sup><a href="#command-line-gui">7</a></sup>. Likewise, the inverse is possible and advances in GUI
                    tools can serve as an inspiration to enhancing command line. Whether we need further standardization
                    or the use of more natural language
                    is left as an open question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though some shells<sup><a href="#shell">15</a></sup> provide suggestions when users make mistakes in
                    typing commands and also let them search some recently typed commands, this user experience is
                    indeed incomparable to personalized user-experiences
                    on web services which follows data-driven or usage-driven approach. It is sad to note that shells
                    make limited use of user command history to recommend commands to users or provide a <b>personalized
                        command-line experience</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some commands like MySQL<sup><a href="#mysql">13</a></sup>, MariaDB<sup><a
                            href="#mariadb">12</a></sup> have their own internal <b>REPL (Read–eval–print
                        loop)</b><sup><a href="#repl">14</a></sup> that permit them to provide another language
                    (e.g. SQL) for user interaction. Usually such languages are declarative and tend to be
                    natural-language (usually English) friendly. This approach permits the developers of command-line
                    tools to go beyond using standard command-line parsers
                    and flexibly create <i>user-friendly</i> command line options. Some of these REPL tools are
                    multi-user and multi-profile. Therefore it is also possible to make use of REPL user command history
                    to personalize user experience for the purpose
                    of autocompletion, argument recommendations (suggestions) etc. similar to the features seen in
                    search engines. Nevertheless, popularity of such declarative languages has given birth to new set of
                    administration tools like <code>osquery</code><sup><a href="#osquery">11</a></sup> that reuse the
                    syntax of SQL to query about system resources. Thus <code>osquery</code> lets the user perform
                    system usage analytics considering processes, users, memory as relational tables instead of
                    memorizing commands like <code>ps, top</code> etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating search and filter options, commands with no fixed word order, use of synonyms, support
                    for natural language phrases (today, two weeks from today etc.)<sup><a href="#next-ui">7</a></sup>
                    is crucial for next-generation command-line
                    experience. Some years ago, Ubiquity<sup><a href="#mozilla-ubiquity">8</a></sup>, an experimental
                    project by Mozilla demonstrated a textual interface to preview and execute various user actions. It
                    demonstrated how users can type <i>action verbs</i> like translate, email along with arguments.
                    Users need not memorize the <i>action verbs</i>, since synonyms can also be used. The action verbs
                    were configured to associated services and the users have the option to preview before actually
                    executing the action. Another interesting feature was the support for <b>multilinguality</b><sup><a
                            href="#ubiquity">9</a></sup>. This support for internationalization by supporting action
                    verbs in other human languages helps non-English-speaking
                    users to access various web services in very much the same way that an English speaking user does.
                    The action verb need not be in the beginning, e.g. <code>email "emailid" "message"</code>. It could
                    also be at the end of a sentence, depending
                    on the language. Besides, mnemonics or abbrevations can also be used for these verbs. Language-based
                    interface<sup><a href="#feature">4</a></sup> is as promising or is even better compared to an
                    icon-based interface, providing many more
                    flexible options to the end users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    fish (friendly interactive shell)<sup><a href="#fish-shell">16</a></sup> is an oft-talked about
                    shell for its user-experience. One notable feature is its (default) use of <b>colors</b>, that helps
                    user to easily distinguish between files,
                    directories and even error messages. Applications have changed a lot. Gone are the days when
                    applications were run on a single machine. Current generation of tools manage multiple distributed
                    machines for storage or parallel computing<sup><a href="#gnu-parallel">17</a></sup> and are often
                    multi-threaded. Those familiar with printing log messages from a multithreaded process are aware of
                    the difficulty to distinguish between messages from different threads or processes (unless some
                    distinguishing phrases are
                    added in the beginning); a key reason being the legacy two-colored approach to handling output/error
                    messages from the processes. Colors need to be fully integrated to CLI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another interesting feature will be the ability to track the <b>progress of commands</b>. Commands
                    like <code>progress, pv</code> etc. are limited to certain commands or when data pipelines (i.e.,
                    use of <code>|</code>) are used. User
                    interaction with commands (especially long-running commands) permits user to further complex tools
                    involving one or more commands depending on the current status of commands. Furthermore, pipes can
                    be enhanced to support multiple data
                    pipelines (currently supported by commands like <code>parallel</code><sup><a
                            href="#gnu-parallel">17</a></sup>). Indeed, the use of pipes can be further used to
                    recommend and create <i>command mashups</i>.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    With the growing number of human-computer interfaces, it is easy to question the relevance of
                    command line interface. Yet it is still commonly used by the developers as well as by administrators
                    and several new tools have a command line interface along
                    with the graphical user interface. Several researchers have proposed ways to enhance the command
                    line and this article took a look at some of these propositions. Command line interface needs to be
                    much more user friendly, providing a personalized
                    user experience based on past history of commands, adding additional support for natural language
                    and making use of colors.
