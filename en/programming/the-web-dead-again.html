            <p>
                The Web landscape is rapidly changing.
                Our behavoir on the web has changed over all these years.
                From web directories to web search engines, the way we navigate and search the internet for information
                has evolved.
                With the social media content behind the walled gardens, the web became more fragmented.
                From publicly available websites to content behind closed accounts, this evolution has also helped us to
                distinguish between public and private information.
                Yet another revolution is nigh.
                The arrival of Generative AI models has ignited serious debates on the web.
                Large language models and image (or media) generation models help produce content at a rapidly
                increasing rate.
                A new user behaviour seems to be emerging.
                The generation of personalized content generation to user search queries will mean that the users do not
                need to click external websites.
                What does it mean to the website owners, blog writers, and for the future of the web?
            </p>

            <h4>Changes.. and more changes</h4>
            <p>
                Looking back to the last three decades, we can clearly observe the evolution of the web.
                So have the search engines.
                But, what is the relation between the web and the search engines?
                Why do they need to be seen together?
                The decentralized nature of the web means that anyone, anywhere can create content on the web.
                However, these content need to be discovered.
                Unless some website links to them, these newly created websites will never be discovered.
                Throughout all these years, the search engines have played an important role in indexing almost all the
                websites on the web and played a role in helping users discover new content on the web.
                Initially, there were websites that maintained a directory of different categories of websites.
                Users could disvover the websites by going through all the websites of their preferred category.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as more and more organizations decided to create an online presence on the web, things become
                complicated.
                The search engines played an important role in helping users find relevant websites from thousands (or
                even millions) of websites.
                Users could make a search query on the search engines using some keywords
                From showing a list of ten search results with the now popular blue-green links, we ask our questions
                directly to the web
                Take, for example, when it comes to weather forecast, we type the 'city name temparature" and there we
                are with the results of the weather forecast on the same web page, without the need for clicking any
                links to the external website
                This simplified our lives.
                However, this also changed how we consume information on the web
                Search engines directly give us the results.
                We no longer click the links or use it less often.
            </p>

            <p>

                Another change that we observed was the possibility to ask questions directly to the search engines with
                complete phrases
                No more keyword based search combinations.
                One could easily ask, "What's the temperature of Lyon"?

                The coming of AI is now going to make our lives simpler and we may now be able to ask more complex
                questions
                In fact, we may be able to converse to the search engines
                The search engines could guide us to the answers that we are looking for, all the time without leaving
                the website.
            </p>

            <p>


                What about the sources?
                As the debate is raging all over the internet, how are these answers obtained.
                There are persons and organizations who put time and energy to prepare the content for their blogs and
                websites
                However, these sources are usually missing from these conversations
                It must be pointed out that these models may give references when we explicitly ask them
                Unless if they are hallucinating and coming out with some imaginary references.
            </p>

            <p>

                However, my major concern is about the web.
                Yes, the web that I love.
                The vision of the decentralised web, where people could freely express their opinions, and cite other
                people's work with links, an interconnected web of information.
                That vision of the web is long gone and now replaced by walled gardens with no possibility to access the
                information easily without creating accounts.
                The preceding years have helped us understand the various nuances of open data access.
                We see people understanding the importance of privacy and asking for settings to manage private
                information.
                Not all information is meant for general public consumption.
                However, there are certain information that needs to be public and not behind the walled gardens,
                especially those related to public safety and health, official announcements.
            </p>

            <p>

                With the advancement of the AI models, the access to the information for the general public is becoming
                more difficult
                Companies are making it difficult to access the data by making the API access available with a price
                tag.
                This is because the data was scrapped without their consent and the financial benefits do not reach the
                owners of these cmpanies
                Furthermore, some of the AI models do not suggest the source. Hence, the owners lose the traffic and
                thereby, the source of their income.
                Compared to the the social networking service, this situation is more grim since social networking
                services offered the possibility the users to share links.
            </p>

            <p>

                Now we also hear about AI engine optimization, which means that in addition to the search engine
                optimization, the website owners need to optimize their content in order to
                ensure that their content appears in the responses of the AI models.
                Search engine optimization ensured that your website appears on the first page of the search engines for
                certain phrases, keywords typed by the users.
                The optimization of our websites for making sure that the company products appear in the suggested
                answers.
            </p>

            <p>

                Is the web dead?
                Is it dead again?
                The web has siginificantly evolved in the last three decades.
                During the shortage of the IPv4 addresses
                The advent of the social media
                The advent of the mobile applications
            </p>

            <p>

                Yet the web is still here.
                The way we interact with the web has changed
                what exactly is the web? The original source for the exchange of information in the form of pages
                We added more addresses to the web with IPv6.
                People and organizations still maintain blogs and websites.
                Focus from HTML to API with the arrival of mobile applications
            </p>

            <h4>Prediction</h4>
            <p>

                The web is going nowhere
                decentralized, commons, interoperability
            </p>
