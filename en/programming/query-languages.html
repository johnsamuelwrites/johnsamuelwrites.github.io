                <h3>Unraveling Data Insights: A Journey Through Query Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    Query languages [1] serve as indispensable tools for addressing user inquiries regarding our data
                    assets. In the
                    ever-evolving fields of data science and generative AI, these query languages are in the midst of a
                    transformation, adapting to seamlessly integrate with diverse data sources. This evolution not only
                    broadens their capacity to offer profound insights but also extends their reach beyond the
                    traditional
                    relational databases and structured data. They now encompass a wide variety of data formats,
                    including
                    structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data, thereby opening up new horizons for data
                    exploration
                    and analysis. However, it's crucial to emphasize that this article primarily focuses on classical
                    textual sources. It's worth noting that there exists a multitude of other media/document formats,
                    such
                    as binary
                    data, images, videos, audios, and the novel vectors harnessed by AI models, which, although not
                    explored
                    here, represent a fascinating format of the ever-expanding AI models.
                </p>
                <h3>Query Languages in the World of Structured Data</h3>
                <p>
                    Databases [2] are renowned for their methodical, well-structured
                    nature, characterized by a schema that delineates available relations or tables and their
                    corresponding
                    attributes. This structural foundation empowers a broad spectrum of data operations, encompassing
                    tasks
                    like data retrieval, sorting, filtering, and conditional searches, as well as executing aggregation
                    analyses, including computations for count, maximum, minimum, and averages. To accomplish these
                    tasks, a
                    set of essential keywords in SQL [3], such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP, ORDER BY, HAVING, COUNT,
                    and
                    more, come
                    into play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the world of structured databases extends further than traditional relations. There exists
                    another
                    facet in the form of databases purpose-built for managing graph data. Graph databases [4] structure
                    information
                    into triples or utilize contemporary property graphs [5]. Query languages like SPARQL [6] and Cypher
                    [7], influenced by
                    SQL, go beyond basic data manipulation. They excel at tackling unique challenges posed by graph
                    data,
                    such
                    as discovering the shortest path [8] or unraveling connections between various points within the
                    graph.
                </p>

                <h3>Querying Semi-Structured Data: The XML Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    For those looking to bypass the complexities of traditional database management, an alternative
                    route
                    exists in the form of semi-structured data formats, with XML serving as a prominent example. These
                    formats, known for their text-based nature, present a more straightforward approach, as they can be
                    effectively managed using files, eliminating the necessity of traditional databases.
                    Specialized languages like XQuery [9] and XPath [10] equip users with the tools to
                    seamlessly query and extract precisely the information they desire. What distinguishes these
                    languages
                    is their exceptional ability to harness the inherent hierarchical structure of such data formats.
                    This
                    unique capability empowers users to navigate through the complex layers of data and uncover the
                    insights they seek with remarkable ease.
                </p>
                <h3>JSON's Soaring Popularity</h3>
                <p>
                    JSON, a lightweight data format reminiscent of XML, has witnessed a remarkable surge in popularity
                    within the data domain. Its inherent simplicity and adaptability have won over numerous data
                    professionals. To navigate and unlock JSON's potential, query languages like JSONPath [11] and
                    JMESPath
                    [12] come
                    into play, providing users with the means to precisely extract the desired information. These
                    languages
                    offer a structured approach to accessing and manipulating JSON data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Command-line tools like <code>jq</code> [13] have also ascended as invaluable assets. These tools
                    empower users to
                    efficiently query and reshape JSON structures, providing a streamlined path to data exploration.
                    JSON's
                    rise as a data format has brought transformative effects to the data analysis. Its user-friendly
                    structure has facilitated smoother data exchange, particularly in web applications, APIs, and
                    various
                    data exchange scenarios.
                </p>
                <h3>The Timeless Appeal of CSV and TSV Formats in Data Handling</h3>
                <p>
                    Amidst the ever-expanding variety of data formats, the enduring simplicity of CSV (Comma-Separated
                    Values) and TSV (Tab-Separated Values) formats remains a steadfast favorite in the data management.
                    These structured textual formats have withstood the test of time, cherished for their approachable
                    and
                    user-friendly characteristics. Over the years, a cadre of command-line tools, featuring stalwarts
                    such
                    as <code>sed</code>, <code>cut</code>, and <code>awk</code>, have emerged as indispensable
                    companions in
                    the craft of working with such data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These tools empower users to execute a wide range of operations, spanning from fundamental text
                    manipulation to data extraction, all within delimited text files. The accessibility of CSV and
                    TSV, coupled with the versatility of these command-line tools, has contributed to their enduring
                    presence in data science. They remain the preferred choice for numerous data professionals,
                    providing
                    efficiency and user-friendliness in managing and extracting insights from structured textual data.

                <h3>Unstructured Data</h3>
                <p>
                    Unstructured data, often in the form of documents, poses a unique challenge in text analyses.
                    Historically, command-line tools like <code>grep</code> have been instrumental in the formidable
                    task of
                    sorting through and extracting valuable insights.
                    However, the data landscape is far from static; it is in a state of perpetual evolution. One
                    significant
                    catalyst for this transformation is the rise of document stores [14]. These specialized databases
                    are
                    reshaping the rules of engagement when it comes to handling and querying unstructured data.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    The world of query languages and their interaction with diverse data formats is a dynamic and
                    ever-evolving field. These languages serve as the linchpin in enabling users to glean insights,
                    manipulate data, and pose inquiries across a wide spectrum of data formats, whether structured,
                    semi-structured, or unstructured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the well-established domain of SQL, which governs relational databases, to the flexibility of
                    languages like XQuery, SPARQL, and JSONPath, designed for XML, graph databases, and JSON, the
                    adaptability of query languages continues to broaden its horizons. Their proficiency in navigating
                    intricate data hierarchies, managing real-time streaming data, and harmonizing with various formats
                    has
                    ushered in a revolution in our approach to data analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the advent of specialized tools and document stores has democratized the process of
                    querying unstructured data like never before. This evolutionary journey underscores the adaptability
                    and
                    resilience of query languages in the face of an ever-shifting field of (textual) data analysis.
