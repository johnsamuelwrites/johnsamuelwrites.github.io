                    Our thoughts, as well as interests evolve and our reading sometimes reflects this evolution. A major
                    part of our reading has now moved to the internet and the way we use to read the news on the
                    internet has changed dramatically over the past few years.
                    From reading news on certain news outlets to reading the news headlines on social media, we can get
                    a glimpse of this rapid change of the reading habits of users. However, we still use some sort of
                    bookmarking<sup><a href="#bookmark">1</a></sup> for saving certain articles for future reads and
                    references. These bookmarks<sup><a href="#bookmark-web">3</a></sup>, whether on browsers or social
                    media websites contain valuable information, which can be used to improve our future reading
                    as well as remind us of some forgotten topics of past interests. A reading profile can be built by
                    the analysis of the articles read in the past and the associated tags used by the readers. This
                    article explores some of the key information
                    that can be obtained from <b>bookmarked and tagged articles</b>, especially for revisiting some
                    forgotten topics.
                </p>
                <h3>Analysis of Bookmarks</h3>
                <h4>1. Identifying the Data Sources</h4>
                <p>There are primarily two data sources for building a user reading profile: <b>bookmarks from internet
                        browsers</b> and <b>bookmarks from social media</b>. Blogs, news websites, and news
                    aggregators<sup><a href="#aggregator">6</a></sup> were
                    frequently used by the readers in the past for reading. This however limited the users to a limited
                    number of websites. However, bookmarking web services and social media have exposed them to a large
                    number of websites, thanks to the possibility
                    of sharing. Social media help users discover relevant media from the users interested in similar
                    topics. Users use their browsers to navigate these articles and even bookmark them. However, some
                    social media companies display a snippet
                    of the article (including an image and a small text) which helps the readers get a glimpse of the
                    article content without clicking it. Many social media websites have different ways to let users
                    bookmark such information. Some of the following
                    may not seem completely close to the explicit option for bookmarks, since bookmarks are usually
                    considered to be something personal. But the following information may be public or available to a
                    group of users (depending on the settings).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Likes and Favorites</li>
                    <li>Retweets and reposts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Internet browsers usually use HTML, XML, or JSON data format to store the bookmarks. But the data
                    format is <b>not standardized</b> across browsers. Browsers let you export or import bookmarks in
                    HTML format. In some cases like Firefox,
                    user tags are not present in the exported HTML file. One option here, in the case of Firefox, is to
                    make use of bookmark backups that provide a lot of information usually absent in the exported files
                    like the logo URL of the bookmarked
                    sites, time of bookmarking, user-generated tags. Social media websites provide application
                    programming interfaces (or API) so that the developers can access some of the above information.
                </p>
                <h4>2. Data Analysis</h4>
                <p>
                    So the next obvious question that arises: what are the <b>data available for performing
                        analysis</b><sup><a href="#data-analysis">7</a></sup> and <b>what do we want to achieve from
                        this analysis</b>? Following is a list of data available
                    from the exported bookmark HTML and bookmark backup JSON files from browsers:
                </p>

                            <li>Tags or hashtags<sup><a href="#tag">5</a></sup></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>In addition to the above, the social media companies provide additional information based on their
                    own analysis. The following information is also available to the readers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of users who bookmarked the article</li>
                    <li>Number of times an article was shared</li>
                    <li>The users who shared the article</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is a treasure-trove of information. Take for example, given the availability of time, one
                    interesting aspect is to know what theme of topics interested me during specific periods of time and
                    when did a particular topic catch my first attention. Tags
                    and categories (or folders) may also give an idea of the information classification style, in this
                    case, how the users categorize different articles under a category or a sub-category. Internet
                    browsers usually allow only one category
                    (or subcategory) for an article. Tags may play an important role in the classification since an
                    article can have more than one tag.
                </p>

                    Now that we have seen the data to analyze, we can take a look at how to infer interesting insights
                    with these data. Some non-exhaustive questions are given below:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Bookmarks
                        <ul>
                            <li>Total number of bookmarks</li>
                            <li>The average number of bookmarks in a day/week/month/year</li>
                            <li>Maximum number of bookmarks made on a day/week/month/year</li>
                            <li>Minimum number of bookmarks made on a day/week/month/year</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Websites
                        <ul>
                            <li>Total number of unique websites</li>
                            <li>The average number of bookmarks per website</li>
                            <li>The website with the maximum number of bookmarks or commonly referred website(s)</li>
                            <li>The website with the least number of bookmarks or the least referred website(s)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Tags/Categories
                        <ul>
                            <li>Total number of unique tags/categories</li>
                            <li>Tags/categories with the maximum number of bookmarks or the most common tags</li>
                            <li>Tags/categories with the minimum number of bookmarks or the least used tags</li>
                            <li>Tags/categories with the maximum number of websites or the most common tags</li>
                            <li>Tags/categories with the minimum number of websites or the most common tags</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Analytics Information
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tags of interest</li>
                            <li>Users interested in similar topics</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the above questions are based on the aggregation functions like count, minimum, maximum,
                    average. These are commonly used tasks in data analysis in almost every domain. This information is
                    sufficient enough to build a basic reading profile. But care
                    must be taken to ensure that it doesn't lead to building a profile that ignores the least commonly
                    used bookmarks or websites. In other words, data analysis must also help in <b>filtering out the
                        forgotten topics or bookmarks and websites</b>.
                    To revisit the forgotten topics, one needs to focus on the least frequented websites, the least used
                    tags, the least used categories, etc. Additionally, the focus must be on the past bookmarks and not
                    on the recent ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, most of our current recommendation systems<sup><a href="#content-filtering">8</a>,<a
                            href="#recommender-systems">9</a></sup> focus on aspects like recency. Hence recent posts
                    and articles have a prominent place on the search
                    results. Certain past topics of interest never appear in the results.
                </p>
                <h4>3. Data Visualization</h4>
                <p>What better way to analyze than to <b>visualize</b>! Visualization techniques help not only to find
                    interesting patterns but also to pop out striking features. As time passes, bookmark related
                    information accumulates. When the number of data
                    increases, it's usually not feasible to analyze them with tables. More data need to be analyzed than
                    those that can be analyzed at a single glance. There are a large number of visualization libraries
                    available that can help to obtain a
                    word cloud<sup><a href="#tagcloud">2</a></sup> corresponding to bookmarked articles, particularly to
                    understand the main topics of interest. Then some can be used to visualize the pattern of website
                    visits on a timeline. This idea can
                    be extended to understand the (recurrent) pattern of bookmarks concerning a particular topic. The
                    interesting results thus obtained can be fed back to the system in the form of new user-generated
                    tags.
                </p>
                <h3>Building a Reading Profile</h3>
                <p>
                    Such a reading profile built after analysis of past bookmarks can be used to recommend articles. But
                    a mere recommendation isn't enough. The justification for a recommendation must also be presented.
                    This contextual information can be verified and any
                    corrections required can be fed back to the system for improving the recommendation mechanism. Most
                    of the current recommendation systems are opaque about their functioning. However, content-based
                    filtering systems focus on individual
                    users and not on the results related to multiple users. This is extremely relevant in the case of
                    bookmarks analysis, especially when the user is interested in quantifying themself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important aspect of reading is the surprise factor. Users must get a certain amount of
                    articles that are surprising that may help them to exit their filter bubble. And as discussed above,
                    the past topics of interest and the least visited sites
                    may give certain insights.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    The overall goal of bookmark analysis, especially for individual users may not be to understand
                    reading behavior but to save time skipping through irrelevant or redundant articles. Yet some users
                    may wish to understand the time taken by them on the internet,
                    their reading habits, the topics of interest, the number of bookmarks they had made during a period,
                    etc. Others may use it to understand and revisit the forgotten topics. By clustering the articles
                    based on theme and grouping similar
                    articles, relevant and non-redundant articles can be shown to the users. But the aspect of surprise
                    (e.g., new technological advancement) should not be missing from the overall scene of filtering.
                    <b>Information overload</b> is a major challenge, but there are several ways to reduce it, and just
                    focusing on recency should not be one of them.
