                    Language learning is both fun and challenging. If you already know speak one language and wish to
                    explore a new language, a language very close to the language you know, the first few weeks of
                    language learning may be fun. You find and even try to find
                    the similarities between the two languages and, you enter the state of confidence that this language
                    learning is not as difficult as it seemed. However, reality strikes when we venture to listen to a
                    few videos and TV series. We finally
                    realize that though we can get some words in the program, we have not understood the vast majority
                    of them, and we are lost somewhere between our pronunciation and our comprehension. This is indeed a
                    difficult phase, which each one of
                    us needs to traverse to avoid giving up completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having done my studies in computer science, I tried to reduce the challenge of language learning to
                    some concepts that I had learned in computer programming, notably, the concept of object-oriented
                    programming<sup><a href="#oop">1</a></sup>.
                    In object-oriented programming, we need to create classes, specify their properties, and define the
                    relationships among classes. Once our model is ready, we create instances of these classes. For
                    example, we may create classes like <i>Language</i>,
                    <i>Book</i>, <i>Author</i>, etc., for describing languages, books, authors, etc. Example properties
                    comprise the name of the language, the number of speakers of a language, the book price, author
                    name, the author's place of residence,
                    etc. The relationships include <i>written in</i> between the classes <i>Book</i> and <i>Language</i>
                    and <i>creator</i> between <i>Book</i> and <i>Author</i>. And examples of objects include the
                    instances of these languages. English is
                    an instance of <i>Language</i> and hence an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may seem that language learning is not very close to the above approach of object-oriented
                    programming. However, I considered all such classes as common nouns and, I tried to learn their
                    translations in the new language. The choice of such common nouns
                    may depend on the context and purpose of your language learning. The common nouns that I learned
                    initially included bus, road, train, food, bread, pen, pencil, some important vegetables, fruits,
                    etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What about the properties and relationships? This is indeed a difficult question and often a matter
                    of multiple discussions by programmers and system designers. Should I use <i>written by</i> or
                    <i>creator</i> as the property name? Is
                    <i>wrote</i> a good relationship compared to <i>written by</i>? However, I approached the properties
                    as a way to learn verbs. Hence, I focused on the translations for the words <i>write</i>,
                    <i>create</i>, etc. Another important group
                    of verbs includes the verbs associated with the five senses: see, hear, taste, touch (feel), smell,
                    etc. Learning the translations for these verbs is essential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every object has a state, depending on the current values of the properties. A book may be a
                    <i>recent</i> work of the author. Thus the state is interesting, and this may seem close to
                    adjectives in languages. Yet states are expressed
                    in different ways in different languages. For example, the sentence "I am hungry" may be translated
                    to "J'ai faim" in French, which can be literally translated to "I have hunger" in English. Now
                    <i>hungry</i> is an adjective, and <i>hunger</i> is a noun. So, the mere translations of words may
                    not sometimes help in language learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relationships and properties may bring us to prepositions. For example, <i>written by</i> uses the
                    preposition <i>by</i>. Thus the next words to learn were the prepositions: in, on, before, after,
                    above, below, etc. These prepositions
                    can express the relationships between different objects. In real life, these prepositions can also
                    specify the position of objects relative to the other objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how will I describe my initial days of language learning and even my future language learning
                    objectives? Given below is a refined approach considering the shortcomings of my past learning
                    methods. Walking in the streets or standing at a particular
                    place, I look around and observe different objects of daily life. For how many objects do I know the
                    translation? What characteristics interest me? The height of the tree, the length, the breadth of
                    the road, etc. These are interesting
                    properties and reminded me of interesting nouns. But these properties also opened the way for new
                    adjectives like long, short, tall, wide, etc. And how to talk about the relationships between the
                    objects or about the objects composed of
                    other objects? How could I talk about the position of objects relative to each other? The car is on
                    the road; the cat is in the house, etc. How comfortable was I with the translations of different
                    objects in the streets, their properties,
                    and their relationships among one another? Did I have words for each of these different aspects? I
                    could measure my language learning level with this approach at any place and any point.

                    But language is not just about words for objects, properties, and relationships. Language needs to
                    express much-complicated aspects, like past events, possible dreams, future events, etc. Computer
                    scientists often cite Bunge–Wand–Weber<sup><a href="#bww">2</a></sup> model for its expressive
                    power. I wish one day I would write about it comparing my language learning skills with this model.
                    But until then, I am happy to share the progress that I made with the approach shared in the
                    article.
