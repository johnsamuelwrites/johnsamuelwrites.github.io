           There are more than one way to express our thoughts in any human language.
           Some based on their acquired vocabulary may express it with one single word whereas others may describe their thoughts in multiple sentences.
           The goal is to express our feelings to others.
           When we start learning a new language, assuming that we already speak at least one language, the initial days of learning is very difficult: a whole new bunch of words and phrases.
           Learning becomes significantly difficult when the new language has a different script from the languages that we already know.
           But can language learning be made simpler?
           Do we really need to learn multiple languages?
           What could be the first phrases to learn?
           This article explores some of these questions.

           They say that there are more than one way to express our thoughts and feelings.
           If we do not have the words, we express them with gestures; we try some or other means including drawing to express ourselves.
           But what if we are limited to words in a language?
           What if the only option before us is to speak in a given language?
           And what if we need to express ourselves in multiple human languages, especially languages from different language families<sup><a href="#language-family">1</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
           Learning a new language is significantly difficult.
           When we see children learning a new language (or even their first language), we are surprised with their rapid progress.
           And as adults, we struggle to learn and retain the vocabulary from the new language, forget for a while the various grammar rules.
           I often feel confused when it comes to using the right gender for objects and sometimes the right tense in a foreign language.
           Despite these struggles, I still love language learning.

           There is no doubt being bilingual or multilingual or even polyglot has several advantages<sup><a href="#foreign-language">6</a>,<a href="#language-tolerance">8</a></sup>.
           Several research studies have shown its positive effect on the brain<sup><a href="#bilingual-brain">5</a></sup>.
           But what is also more important is to be able to preserve our dying tongues<sup><a href="#dying-language">7</a></sup>.
           Languages are endangered and with the extinction of some of them, we have also lost our ability to express feelings, thoughts and ideas in other possible manners than how we usually express them. 
           Hence there are increasingly many efforts to prevent<sup><a href="#bilingualism">2</a></sup> the extinction of languages that we know today (the remaining languages).
           Several efforts of online communities including Wikipedia<sup><a href="#wikidata-language">11</a>,<a href="#wikipedia-language">12</a></sup> are notable in this regard.

	   Here are some of my approaches to learn a new language.
	   I think some of these methods are also followed by other language learners.
	   The first important question is to know how close is the new language to the language or languages you already know.
	   This will give you an estimate for the effort required.
	   One interesting way is to take a look at the language tree.
	   The language tree can help you easily visualize the distance between the new language and the languages that you already know. 
	   Do these languages derive from a common language?
	   Is this common very high up in the tree, quite far from the two languages that you are comparing?
	   These are important questions, since it will help you decide whether or not you have to learn a new script, the common characters between the two scripts, their pronunciation and even the presence of common words.
	</p>
        <p>
	   While learning a new language, most of us approach it using word by word translation, which in many cases may not work for phrases or complete sentences.
           It may be useful for learning the translation of certain common nouns, but not very useful for phrases or even verb phrases.
	   This is something that I observed while language learning.
	   Sometimes the verb phrase in one languages can be translated to multiple verb phrases.
	   A sentence may use different verb phrases depending on the subject or the object of your sentence.
	</p>
        <p>Sometimes a single word may not exist in the new language for expressing an emotion, or describing an object or concept.
           Some languages tend to economize words, whereas others do not.
	   Words may have multiple senses.
	   It may be difficult for the language learners to make this shift easily.
	   The language learners may either have to learn new words for every sense or associate every sense (in their initial language) to a single word in the new language.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Another important aspect of language learning is to be clear about the goals from the very beginning.
	  Are you learning a language for written or oral communication or both?
	  Written communication often require more formal approaches and one cannot use the ideas expressed in written communication in an oral communication context.
	  It may sound very wierd to the listeners of the new language.
          Also in case of written communication, it is important to note that the punctuation marks are not really universal.
	  Languages use different characters to express the end of a sentence.
	  A language may have more or less tenses, aspects, genders compared to your first language.
	</p>
        <p>
	   I have identified some key stages in my language learning.
	   My first step is to learn some new words, especially some basic words for introducing onself.
	   At the same time, I also try to watch videos in the new language, but with subtitles in any language that I know.
	   This helps in getting aquainted with the words and sometimes even identifying the already learned words in a speech.
	   This is a very long process since it requires repitition.
	   Watching videos with subtitles help in not only remembering the new vocabulary but also comprehending the different contexts where they can be used.
	</p>
        <p>
	   Is there any learning order for books?
	   The answers depends on the books and learning applications that you use.
	   But if I have none of these at disposal, I approach learning words related to the five senses, some common words of life, pronouns, commonly used verbs, adjectives, daily life objects and places of interest.
	   However, this is also related to the question on the reasons behind your language learning.
	   If you are learning a new language, because you are going to live there, you may have different reasons to learn compared to someone who is interested in learning because of their interest in the movies or books in the new language.
        </p>
        <p>
	   Language learning is difficult for some of us.
	   It may require a lot of reading and practice.
	   However two approaches that may help a lot in language learning is to listen to a lot of videos and to try to write expressing your feelings.
           Thought there are a lot of learning applications and memory tools allowing phased learning, at the end of the day, it's the daily practise that play a major role in language learning.
