                    Human languages have evolved significantly over the past millennium. To avoid ambiguity and ensure
                    preciseness, some people have even constructed new languages during the past decades. A few such
                    languages were constructed for special purposes and short
                    use. The newer recent ones called the programming languages are meant for communication between
                    humans and machines. However, all of them face a major problem: extinction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2019 was celebrated as the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL)<sup><a
                            href="#iyil">1</a></sup>. Many languages around the world are in danger of extinction. There
                    must be some efforts to protect the languages from complete
                    oblivion. Thanks to the various campaigns during the awareness year of IYIL, several media articles
                    on indigenous languages were published. People around the world got to know about the diversity of
                    languages in different countries, their
                    level of endangerment<sup><a href="#endangerment">8</a></sup>, and their extinction. Some
                    researchers suggest that protecting linguistic diversity may play an important role in preserving
                    the biodiversity of the world.<sup><a href="#biodiversity">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    UNESCO has documented<sup><a href="#endangeredlanguages">2</a></sup> thousands of endangered
                    languages under 5 categories: vulnerable, definitely endangered, severely endangered, critically
                    endangered, and extinct. Around 2500 languages
                    were documented by this process, considering factors like the number of speakers, the domain of use
                    of language, transfer of language knowledge to newer generations, the frequency of use of language,
                    etc. Unfortunately, extinct languages
                    are those languages that have no speakers left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the above languages took hundreds of years to be formalized. Historians and academicians
                    worked
                    together from time to time to codify the language script and grammar rules. But human languages have
                    several issues. Ambiguous sentences, metaphors,
                    change of word meanings, etc. make it difficult for the readers to decipher the original meaning
                    after
                    several decades. There are constructed languages<sup><a href="#constructedlanguages">3</a></sup>
                    that
                    have been designed,
                    taking into account these limitations. They are often designed for communication between a group of
                    people for a formal and precise way to define concepts. Some are even created especially for movies,
                    for
                    the communication between fictional
                    characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then there are programming languages, specially created for communication between humans and
                    machines. Several have been created since the 1950s. Many look close to some human languages, like
                    English. However, the syntax and semantics of these programming
                    languages are well conceived by the language designers. Even though we find some ongoing attempts to
                    replace these programming languages with languages close to the natural language, current research
                    efforts are still far from achieving
                    this goal. Machines neither comprehend the programming languages nor the human language; they need
                    translators or programs that translate these languages into machine languages. These programs are
                    often referred to as compilers<sup><a href="#compilers">4</a></sup> or interpreters and must be
                    properly designed without ambiguity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several efforts to document and preserve the human languages. The questions remain for the
                    constructed languages and the programming languages. Programming languages have been evolving at a
                    very rapid rate. The languages that were popular decades
                    ago have very few programmers now. It is sometimes too difficult to find developers and maintainers
                    for many of the systems developed in these languages<sup><a href="#cobol">5</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The evolution of languages never stops. We have already seen the change in the prominent language
                    used for scientific communication within a couple of centuries. Thanks to the preservation efforts
                    for the human languages and considering the existing number
                    of speakers, we can still access, translate, and comprehend a few ancient scientific documents. But
                    there are numerous cave paintings and writings that have not been decoded by the scientific
                    community. Documentation related to the associated
                    writing systems could not be found. Similarly, the obsolete information systems developed in some
                    older programming languages will one day become incomprehensible if we have no documentation related
                    to the syntax and semantics of the various
                    keywords used in these programming languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Documenting human languages, constructed languages, and programming languages is challenging.
                    Several preservation efforts related to the human languages include documenting the writing system,
                    the grammar, archiving important books written in the language,
                    recording interviews of the native speakers, etc. One may get the impression that programming
                    languages are often ignored in the discussion of preservation efforts. However, digital
                    heritage<sup><a href="#digitalheritage">6</a></sup> has brought this topic to the forefront. There
                    are several ongoing efforts like Software heritage<sup><a href="#softwareheritage">7</a></sup>
                    focusing on documenting and archiving the source code of different publicly available repositories.

                    Many important aspects of our lives have now turned online. Both human communication and
                    human-machine interaction involve digital aspects. Hence our language preservation efforts can
                    consider the three categories of languages considering the availability
                    of these interactions online.
