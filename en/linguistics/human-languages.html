        <p>
           Human languages have evolved significantly over the past millenium.
	   To avoid ambiguity and ensure preciseness, some people have even constructed new languages during the past decades.
	   If in the past, languages were meant for human communication.
	   The newer recent ones called the programming languages are meant for communication between humans and machines. 
        </p>
        <p>
	   2019 was celebrated as the International Year of Indigenous Languages.
           Thanks to this awareness year and various campaigns surrounding it, there were several media articles on the topic of indigenous languages and their level of endangerement to extinction.
	   People around the world got to know about the diversity of languages around the world.
	   Many languages around the world are in danger of extinction.
	   There must be some efforts to protect the languages from complete oblivion.
        </p>
        <p>
	   UNESCO has documents thousands of endangered languages under 5 categories: vulnerable, definitely endangered, severely endangered, critically endangered and extinct.
	   Around 2500 languages were documented by this process, considering factors like the number of speakers, domain of use of language, transfer of knowledge related to language to newer generations, the frequency of use of language, etc.
	   Unfortunately, extinct languages are those languages which have no speakers left.
        <p>
        </p>
	  Then there are constructed languages that have been designed taking into account the limitations of existing human languages like ambiguity.
	  They are often designed for communication between a group of people and sometimes even to formally define concepts.
	  Some are even created specially for movies, for the communication between fictional characters.
        </p>
        <p>
	  And then there are programming languages, especially created for communication between humans and machines. 
	  A number of programming languages have been created since the 1950s.
	  Many of these programming language resemble close to some human languages, like English.
	  However, the syntax and semantics of these programming languages are well conceived by the language designers.
	  Even though there are some ongoing attempts to replace these propgramming languages by languages close to the natural language, current research efforts are still far from achieving this goal.
	  Machines neither comprehend the programming languages nor the human language; they need translators or programs that translate these languages to the machine languages.
	  These programs are often referred to as compilers or interpreters.
        </p>
        <p>
	  There are several efforts to document and preserve the human languages.
	  The questions still remain for the constructed languages and the programming languages.
	  Programming languages have been evolving at a very rapid rate.
	  The languages that were popular decades ago have very few programmers now.
	  It is sometimes to difficult to find developers and maintainers for many of the systems that were developed in these languages.
        </p>
        <p>
	  Evolution of languages cannot be stopped.
	  We have already seen the change in the prominent language used for scientific communication within a couple of centuries.
	  Thanks to the preservation efforts for the human languages as well as considering the existing number of speakers, we can still access, translate and comprehend some of the ancient scientific documents.
	  There are numerous cave painitings and writings that have not been decoded by the scientific community, because we have no documentation related to the writing systems.
	  Similarly, the obselete information systems developed in some older programming languages will one day become incomprehensible if we have no documentation related to the syntax and semantics of the various keywords used in these programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
	  Documenting human languages, constructed languages and programming languages.
	  Several of the preservation efforts related to the human languages include documenting the writing system, the grammar, archiving important books written in the language, recording interviews of the native speakers, etc.
	  One may get the impression that programming languages are often ignored in the discussion of preservation efforts.
	  However, digital heritage have brought this topic to the forefront. 
	  There are several ongoing efforts like Software heritage focusing on documenting and archiving the source code of different publicly available repositories.
	  Many important aspects of our lives have now turned online; both human communication and human-machine interaction involves digital aspects.
	  Hence our language preservation efforts can take the three categories of languages into consideration: humanf languages, constructed languages and programming languages.
