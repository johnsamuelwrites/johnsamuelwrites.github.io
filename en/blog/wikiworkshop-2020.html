                    I got the opportunity to attend Wiki Workshop 2020<sup><a href="#wikiworkshop2020">1</a></sup> on
                    21<sup>st</sup> April, after two years. Unlike the previous workshop of 2018<sup><a
                            href="#wikiworkshop2018">2</a></sup>, which was held
                    in Lyon, France, this one was held online. As far as I recall, this is the first time that I
                    registered and attended a virtual workshop. Nevertheless, the excitement was the same for me as well
                    as for all the participants interested in
                    Wikimedia projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The keynote talk was given by Jess Wade. She is very well known to most Wikipedia researchers and
                    community members for her contributions to improving the gender gap on Wikipedia projects. With
                    multiple examples on how Wikipedia is becoming the first
                    point of reference for not only the general public but also for academics as well as journalists,
                    she stressed on the need for improving the representation of women, LGBTI+, and people of color. The
                    improvement in the visibility of minority
                    communities may play a pivotal role in dealing with societal biases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next in line, was the interview of Mark Graham, Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) by Bob West
                    (EPFL). This interview highlighted some of the common characteristics between the Internet Archive
                    and Wikipedia. Both are increasingly becoming a major destination
                    for finding information. One may even wonder whether this archiving effort can be referred to as the
                    Library of Alexandria version 2.0. During these tough times, such efforts must be indeed amplified
                    especially to deal with the growing
                    problems of disinformation associated with the Coronavirus pandemic. Anybody, especially journalists
                    can contribute to the Internet Archive by saving pages using the Save Page tool<sup><a
                            href="#savepage">3</a></sup>. Researchers
                    can also access this vast data source through its API<sup><a href="#archiveapi">4</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following this interview, there was a panel talk including Kristina Lerman (USC ISI), Misha
                    Teplitskiy (University of Michigan), Benjamin Mako Hill (University of Washington), and Jérôme
                    Hergueux (CNRS). Kristina Lerman talked about her works on algorithmic
                    bias and collaboration. Cognitive diversity and the role of ideological differences of people in
                    communities were the discussion points of Misha Teplitskiy, pointing out that the more ideologically
                    diverse a team is, the more diverse is
                    the Wikipedia page content and the ideological diversity also means that discussion will move to
                    newer and broader topics. Oversight and governance structure were the topics discussed by Jérôme
                    Hergueux, especially how these structures
                    help in the successful creation of rules, but pointing out that these rules become major barriers to
                    entry for women and minorities, hence the importance of the study of behavioral sciences. Finally,
                    Benjamin Mako Hill, who studies the
                    lifecycle of the building of communities talked about the pattern of the initial openness of
                    communities to their eventual closedness, hindering the entry to newbies. Such situations give the
                    impression of competition instead of cooperation.
                    Tiered architecture and the usefulness of badges were also discussed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following this insightful panel discussion, a couple of articles and lightning talks were presented.
                    Wikitrends
                    <sup><a href="#wikitrends">5</a></sup> was demonstrated, which takes into consideration the page
                    views from three languages: English, French, and Russian to study the trends and language biases.
                    Kai Zhu et al. focused on content growth,
                    i.e., the creation of Wikipedia articles, based on the understanding of clickstream data, both from
                    internal and external sources as well as the study of attention propagation. Nicholas Vincent et al.
                    presented the work of the incidence
                    rate of Wikipedia pages on search engine query results for different search engines and different
                    devices (mobile and desktop). Both the number of articles and the position of articles (i.e., the
                    exposure of articles as well as the connectivity
                    with other articles) must be used to understand the geographical bias in the multilingual records of
                    biographies on Wikipedia was suggested by Pablo Beytia et al.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other works took into consideration the field of performing arts (ballet and opera) to understand
                    the network structure and collaboration patterns between the participants using the Pittsburg ballet
                    theatre data as well as Wikidata (Yessica Herrera-Guzman
                    et al.). Automatic scholar profiling based on Wikipedia was also presented. Chien-Chun Ni et
                    al<sup><a href="#graph">6</a></sup>. presented the work on layered graph embedding which focused on
                    embedding generation from
                    Wikilinks graph, Link-main graph (main text), and clickstream graph. Matching Ukrainian redlinks
                    with English Wikipedia was also presented. Another interesting project called Wikigender<sup><a
                            href="#wikigender">7</a></sup> discussed on
                    using machine learning models to detect gender bias, highlighting the bias in adjectives and the
                    bias in nouns for biographies of different genders. Citation detective and citation hunt tool were
                    used to quantify citation quality. It's
                    important to state that statements on Wikipedia require citation (as they famously call it 'citation
                    needed'). Finally an iterative design process was presented to diagnose the incompleteness of
                    Wikidata. There was a poster session, following
                    these presentations.

                    Wiki workshop was indeed an opportunity to learn about several new topics related to Wikimedia
                    projects including Wikipedia and Wikidata. Despite being a virtual event, the organizers had done a
                    pretty good job. This was undoubtedly a unique experience
                    not only for organizers but also for speakers and participants during these tough times.
